"- The study explored solid-state polymer electrolytes (SPEs) for high-energy lithium batteries, focusing on in situ polymerization inside the electrochemical cell."
"- The SPEs showed high ionic conductivity and fast interfacial charge transport at room temperature, beneficial properties for lithium battery performance."
- Lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl) imide (LiTFSI) was used in poly(ethylene oxide) but did not meet the requirements for successful SPEs at room temperature.
- Up to 98% Li plating/striping efficiencies were obtained after 300 charge–discharge cycles.
"- The polymerization of 1,3-dioxolane (DOL) was initiated by cationic aluminum species to create SPEs. The process demonstrated significant improvements, including high purity SPEs and a method for repairing defects in SPEs and ceramic SSEs."
"- The in situ polymerized spe exhibited notable electrochemical stability, overcoming significant limitations of conventional SPEs, enabling practical applications in solid polymer batteries."
