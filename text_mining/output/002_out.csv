"The experimental setup, including the gelation process, involves using commercial liquid electrolyte composed of 1,3-dioxolane (DOL) and 1,2-dimethoxyethane (DME), to which lithium hexafluorophosphate (LiPF6) is added. This initiates the gelation under ambient conditions, transforming the liquid into a quasi-solid gel polymer electrolyte (GPE) through cationic ring-opening polymerization induced by LiPF6. The electrolyte demonstrates improved performance in lithium metal batteries (LMBs), including increased ionic conductivity and enhanced protective effects on lithium anodes, showcasing reduced lithium dendrite growth. Applications explored in the document span LMBs with various cathodes, illustrating the GPE's potential in future energy storage systems."
