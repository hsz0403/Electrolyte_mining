These issues stimulate intensive interest in high safety and high energy density solid state lithium batteries. [2–4] Although some strategies in the modifica-tion of separator could improve the per - formance of lithium ion batteries to some extent, [5,6] the existence of liquid electrolyte always is closely related to a hidden safety hazard. The solid electrolyte is a key com-ponent for ensuring high safety and high voltage window. Among solid state electro- lytes, solid polymer electrolyte takes the advantage of high flex-ibility, easy processability, and low interfacial resistance when compared with inorganic ceramic electrolyte. [7] These merits qualify them promising materials for high energy solid state battery. Till now, three categories of solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) have been extensively reported, i.e., Polyoxyethylene (PEO)based solid electrolyte, succinonitrile based solid electrolyte, and polyester based solid polymer electrolyte. ",244
test_pdfs/001.pdf,1,3,"[3,4,6,8–10] Since Wright and Armand discovered that the PEO based electrolyte possessed considerable ionic conductivity above 10 −7 S cm−1, this solid electrolyte system has attracted extensive interests in academic field as well as industrial community. [11,12] The branched PEO based solid polymer electrolyte has been com-mercialized by DAISO (Japan). However, the main chains of PEO readily crystallize at room temperature to hamper the ion migration resulting in a lower ionic conductivity at room temperature. [13,14] Moreover, it is generally regarded that its electrochemically stability window is lower than 4.0 V versus Li/Li +, which could be well suitable for LiFePO 4, but not for the high voltage cathodes.[8] The succinonitrile based solid electrolytes possessed ultrahigh ionic conductivity above 10−3 S cm–1 at ambient temperature due to the presence of unique plastic–crystalline phase between –40 °C and 60 °C.[9] Lee and co-workers developed a facile strategy to prepare polymer Nowadays it is extremely urgent to seek high performance solid polymer electrolyte that possesses both interfacial stability toward lithium/graphitic anodes and high voltage cathodes for high ener",270

Inspired by the positive interfacial effect of vinylene carbonate additive on solid electrolyte interface, a novel poly (vinylene carbonate) based solid polymer electrolyte is presented via a facile in situ polymerization process in this paper. It is manifested that poly (vinylene carbonate) based solid polymer electrolyte possess a superior electrochemical stability window up to 4.5 V versus Li/Li + and considerable ionic conductivity of 9.82 × 10−5 S cm−1 at 50 °C. Moreover, it is demonstrated that high voltage LiCoO 2/Li batteries using this solid polymer electrolyte display stable charge/discharge profiles, considerable rate capability, excellent cycling performance, and decent safety characteristic. It is believed that poly (vinylene carbonate) based electrolyte can be a very promising solid polymer electrolyte candidate for high energy density lithium batteries.

KGaA, Weinheim network-integrated plastic–crystalline electrolyte for flexible solid state LiCoO 2/Li4Ti5O12 batteries.[15] However, it was indi- cated that succinonitrile possessing two nitrile groups might be electrochemically reduced to generate unstable solid elec-trolyte interface (SEI) on graphite. [16] In addition, succinoni- trile would react with lithium foil anodes. Those drawbacks severely limited its application for high energy solid stable bat-teries. Some polyester-based solid polymer electrolytes, such as poly(propylene carbonate) [4] and poly(ethylene carbonate),[17,18] have achieved great success in high performance of lithium batteries. It has been found that poly(ethylene carbonate)-based solid electrolyte showed an ionic conductivity of the order of 10 −5 S cm−1 at 30 ° C.[17] Zhou et al. also reported that poly(methyl methacrylate-styrene)-based polymer electrolytes have a number of potential applications in Li-O 2 batteries.[19] However, most of polyester-based solid polymer electrolytes were made by ex situ solution casting technique, which used a large amount of solvents and increased the fabrication pro-cedures and cost as well. So, it is extremely urgent to seek high performance solid polymer electrolytes that possess both excellent electrochemical properties and facile preparation technique. In situ polymerization was reported to be such a kind of technique for preparing solid polymer electrolyte in lithium batteries. [20,21] Kang and co-workers have prepared some gel polymer electrolyte by in situ polymerization, which could obtain high performance polymer electrolyte. [21] The monomers or precursors are liquid state, which facilitate to be injected into the batteries. In addition, in situ generated solid electrolytes would have an excel",418
test_pdfs/001.pdf,2,2,"lent contact and affinity with both electrodes. This strategy simplifies the preparation pro-cess of solid polymer electrolyte and cuts the cost of fabrication. Some SEI additives are frequently used in state-of-the-art nonaqueous electrolytes to enhance the interfacial compat-ibility toward lithium/graphitic anodes and high voltage cath-odes, consequently endowing better cycling performance. [22,23] Unsaturated compounds have always been selected as such additives in nonaqueous electrolytes, because unsaturated functional groups (double or triple bonds) provide a site for polymerization under electrochemically reductive (or oxida-tive) conditions. Typically, vinylene carbonate (VC) is one of promising unsaturated additives. [24,25] It was reported that the VC could be polymerized into poly(vinyl carbonate) (PVCA) on the surface of the graphitic anode during charge/discharge process, resulting in the main ingredients of SEI layers and improved the compatibility of the interfacial and cycling per - formance of the batteries. [26] In addition, the presence of VC in solutions would reduce the impedance of cathodes at ambient temperature. [25] Inspired by the positive interfacial effect of the as-generated PVCA on interfacial compatibility, it is believed that PVCA based electrolyte can be a very promising solid polymer electrolyte candidate for high energy density lithium batteries. Herein, this novel PVCA based solid polymer electrolyte was generated via a facile in situ polymerization process. It was demonstrated that this solid polymer electrolyte endowed high voltage LiCoO 2/Li batteries stable charge/discharge profiles, decent rate capability, and excellent cycling performance, which was believed to be promising solid polymer electrolyte for high energy lithium batteries.2.

Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), 1H NMR, and 13C NMR measurements were conducted to ana- lyze the chemical structure of PVCA. As can be seen from the FTIR spectra comparison in Figure 1b that after polymerization the absorption peak at 3166 cm −1 disappeared and a new peak occurred at around 2976 cm−1, which were well assigned to the chemical structure change of the C C double bond into C C single bond. The chemical structure changes of VC to PVCA after in situ polymerization were further confirmed by 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectrum (seen in Figure 1c,d). After polymeri- zation, the proton chemical shift of CH CH double bond was shifted from 8.0 to 5.7 ppm, and the carbon chemical shift was shifted from 130 to 76 ppm, respectively. Both FTIR and NMR spectra verified the chemical structure of PVCA. [27] Gel-permea- tion chromatograph indicated that the weight-average molecular weight (M w) of PVCA could be up to 4.8 × 105 and the polydis- persity (PDI, M w/Mn) was 2.77 (seen in Figure S1, Supporting Information). Lithium difluoro(oxalate) borate (LiDFOB) is a kind of lithium salt used in lithium batteries, possessing the combined chemical structures of lithium bis(oxalate) borate and lithium tetrafluoroborate (LiBF 4). The LiDFOB-based elec- trolytes possessed superior ionic conductivity and elevated temperature property. [23,28] So, LiDFOB was adopted as lithium salt in this paper. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) curve showed that PVCA-LiDFOB had a slightly higher glass-transition temperature (T g) than PVCA (shown in Figure S2, Supporting Information), which was due to the formation of intermolecular interaction between the lithium ion and oxygen atom in C O. And there ",495
test_pdfs/001.pdf,2,4,"is no obvious melting peak for PVCA- LiDFOB at the temperature range between –50 and 100 °C, which meant that PVCA-LiDFOB was an amorphous struc-ture. Thermogravimetric analysis curve displayed that PVCA-LiDFOB had a superior thermal stability that being negligibly volatile until a high temperature of 250 ° C, which was of great significance for the safety improvement of lithium batteries. (seen in Figure S3, Supporting Information). The first weight loss at around 100 ° C was related to the evaporation of trace water present in the sample. In addition, there was no crystal-lization peak in X-ray diffraction (seen in Figure S4, Supporting Information), which was consistent with the result of DSC. It could be seen in Figure 2a that PVCA-LiDFOB was trans- parent. After incorporating into a cellulose nonwoven substrate, the composite cellulose/PVCA-LiDFOB solid polymer electro-lyte (hereafter abbreviated as “PVCA-SPE”) became translucent due to cellulose fibers’ induction (shown in Figure 2b). Scan-ning electron microscope (SEM) was used to observe the sur - face morphology and cross-section of PVCA-SPE. It could be seen from Figure 2c that the surface of PVCA-SPE was quite smooth, which meant that PVCA-LiDFOB had developed a dense coating layer on the surface of cellulose nonwoven sub-strate. The dense coating layer would improve solid/solid inter - face contact between electrolyte and electrode. In addition the cross-section image showed that the thickness of obtained Adv.

Moreover, the in situ generated PVCA-LiDFOB solid polymer electrolyte uniformly incorporated into the voids of cellulose nonwoven, resulting in interconnected channels for lithium ions transportation. To further investigate the interaction between Li + with car - bonate group in PVCA, probability of electron cloud density distribution of the repeating unit of PVCA was calculated by Gaussian software (shown in Figure 3a,b). Natural bond orbital charge of oxygen atom in C O was –0.555, which was slightly lower than that of the oxygen atom in C OC (–0.547 and –0.554), indicating that Li + trended to interact with both of them (seen in Figure S5, Supporting Information). However, steric hindrance effect would probably weaken the interaction of Li + with oxygen atom in C OC, conversely favoring of Li+OC (seen in Figure 3c).

Electrochemical Properties of PVCA-SPE Azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN) is a very common and efficient initiator for free radical polymerization. The charge/discharge curves of liquid electrolyte based LiCoO 2/Li batteries with and without AIBN (1.0 mg mL−1) were displayed in Figure S6 in the Supporting Information. Obviously, such a small amount of AIBN had almost no impact on electrochemical properties of LiCoO 2/Li batteries. So, AIBN was adopted as the initiator for the generation of PVCA-SPE. The temperature-dependent ionic conductivity of PVCA-SPE with 1.0 mg mL −1 AIBN was shown in Figure 4a. The ionic conductivity of PVCA-SPE is 2.23 × 10−5 S cm−1 at 25 °C and 9.82 × 10−5 S cm−1 at 50 °C, which is higher than that of previous reported PEO based elec-trolyte and PAN based electrolyte. [14,30] The ionic conductivity of PEO based electrolyte was only about 2.76 × 10−5 S cm−1 at 50 °C. The temperature-dependent ionic conductivity behavior of polymer electrolytes can be described by ",317

[31,32] The calculated values of VTF fit- ting parameters for PVCA-SPE was shown in Figure 4a. Com-pared with other kinds of polymer electrolytes, [3] PVCA-SPE has a lower activation energy (0.030 eV), indicative of the low energy barrier for lithium ion transfer in PVCA-SPE. As we know, in dual ions conducting system, anions of salt usually move much faster than lithium cations, which makes the lithium ion transference number lower than 0.5. [33,34] In lithium ion battery, only lithium ion is effectively involved into electrode reaction and lithium ion conductivity itself is contrib-uted to the effective conductivity. The lithium ion transference number is a critical factor regarding the ionic conductivity and generally a high transference number is desi",281

As seen from Figure 4b, the current value reached a plateau of 27.6 µA from the ini-tial current value of 32.4 µA at a voltage of 0.05 V. It should be noted that there are two semicircles in the alternating cur - rent impedance spectra. The semicircle at high frequency was assigned to the bulk resistance of the polymer electrolyte and its capacitance in parallel. [35] The broad semicircle in the Adv.

The interfacial resistance was considered to comprise of a surface film resistance on Li and the charge-transfer resist-ance of the Li + + e− = Li reaction. As can be seen from the inset of Figure 4b, the interfacial resistance changed from 1300 to 1370 Ω after polarization process. From Bruce–Vincent–Evans equation, we could easily obtain the lithium ion transference number of PVCA polymer electrolyte (0.57), much higher than PEO-based polymer electrolyte (≈0.2). [12,33,36] So, the high lithium ion transference number of PVCA polymer electrolyte is beneficial for an enhanced power capability. A wide electrochemical stability window is a critical factor for high performance electrolyte of high voltage battery. Asym-metrical cells of Li/PVCA-SPE/stainless steel were assembled to evaluate the electrochemical stability window of PVCA-SPE. Figur",264

As shown in Figure 4d, the current density began to increase obviously at 4.5 V versus Li/Li + at 50 °C. It corresponded to the start of oxidative decom- position of the electrolyte.[32] So, PVCA-SPE exhibited excellent electrochemical stability even at the elevated temperature. The excellent solid/solid interface compatibility would prevent fur - ther oxidation of electrolyte, which endow this solid electrolyte a better electrochemical stability, resulting in a better cycle per - formance of lithium batteries. The electrochemical compatibility of PVCA-SPE/Li inter - phase was estimated by monitoring the impendence trend with a long-term lithium deposition/striping cycles. Figure 5a,b presented the cycling performance of symmetric Li/PVCA-SPE/Li cells at a current density of 0.05 and 0.10 mA cm −2, respec- tively. The slight and synchronous voltage fluctuation could be observed in the deposition/striping process at the current density of 0.05 and 0.10 mA cm −2, which may be due to the fluctuation of",262

In addi-tion, there was no observable short circuit phenomenon after 600 h polarization at both 0.05 and 0.10 mA cm −2. The suffi- cient rigidity of solid state PVCA-SPE would suppress dendrite crossover during long-term cycle and prevent short circuit occurrence, indicating a good compatibility between PVCA-SPE and lithium anode. The interfacial stability of PVCA-SPE with lithium metal had also been evaluated by analyzing the impedance variation of the Li/PVCA-SPE/Li symmetrical cell for a period of 30 d (shown in Figure 5c). The alternating current impedance spectra of symmetrical cell were shown in Figure 5d. There were two semicircles in the impedance spectrum, which was due to the bulk electrolyte resistance and interfacial resistance between lithium electrode and polymer electrolyte. As can be seen from Figure 5d, no obvious variation of bulk electrolyte resistance was found during the measuring process. The interfacia",240

Figure S7 in the Supporting Information dis-played the result of ac impedance spectra of symmetrical cells. Ex-site PVCA-SPE showed the highest interfacial resistance among these three polymer electrolytes, due to its poor inter - facial contact with lithium electrode. It was worth noting that the interfacial resistance of Li/PEO-SPE/Li cell would decrease from 3400 to 2800 Ω when the cells were stored at 80 °C for 2 h. So, PVCA-SPE obtained from in situ generation possessed improved interfacial compatibility with the electrodes. 2.3. LiCoO 2/PVCA-SPE/Li Battery Performances The electrochemical performance of the PVCA-SPE based lithium batteries was evaluated by using high voltage LiCoO 2 (4.3 V) as the cathode and Li metal as the anode. The preparation of solid polymer lithium batteries via an in situ generation process was represented in Figure S8 in the Supporting Information. The bat-teries were stored at 60 ° C for 24 h and 80 ° ",277

Figure S9 in the Supporting Information presented the charge/discharge curves of PVCA-SPE based LiCoO 2/Li cells at a cur - rent density of 0.1 C (15 mA g−1) at 25 ° C. The LiCoO 2/Li bat- tery delivered reversible capacity of about 97 mAh g−1 at a current density of 0.1 C, which was due to the low ionic conductivity of PVCA-SPE and large polarization at 25 ° C. However, PEO-based LiCoO 2/Li cells had a lower discharge capacity of 25 mAh g−1 (seen in Figure S9, Supporting Information). PEO-based solid polymer electrolyte cannot satisfy the general conditions making lithium batteries operate at room temperature, although previous approaches have been investigated. [37,38] It was noteworthy that PVCA-SPE based LiCoO 2/Li battery exhibited a high discharge capacity and an excellent cycling performance at a constant cur - rent density of 0.1 C at 50 ° C (shown in Figure 6a,b). The initial discharge capacity was 146 mAh g−1 with an initial coulombic efficiency of 93.5%. After a fifth charge/discharge cycle, the cou-lombic efficiency would reach to a stable value about 99.3%. After the 1",295

Figure S10 in the Supporting Infor - mation displayed the AC impedance spectra and its equivalent circuit of PVCA-SPE based LiCoO 2/Li battery at full-charged state of first cycle, third cycle, and tenth cycle. AC impedance spectra of PVCA-SPE based LiCoO 2/Li battery showed that the resist- ance of LiCoO 2/Li battery would slightly increase with the cycle number. The increased resistance mainly derived from the for - mation of passivation film between lithium metal and PVCA-SPE interface. Fortunately, the resistance becomes stable after third cycle process, which was very important for long cycle perfor - mance of PVCA-SPE based LiCoO 2/Li battery.

Conclusion In this work, a kind of novel PVCA-based solid polymer elec - trolyte was successfully prepared by a facile in situ radical polymerization process, which possessed both interfacial compatibility toward lithium anode and high-voltage LiCoO 2 cathode (4.3 V vs Li/Li+). The PVCA-SPE displayed a superior electrochemical stability window up to 4.5 V versus Li/Li+ and decent ionic conductivity of 9.82 × 10−5 S cm−1 at 50 °C. The high voltage PVCA-based solid-state LiCoO 2/Li batteries rep - resented superior charge/discharge performance, consider - able rate capability and excellent cyclic performance. The high voltage of LiCoO 2 would endow the lithium ion batteries have a higher energy density (260 Wh Kg−1) than the previous LiCoO 2/ graphite (4.2 V) batteries. Although the ionic conductivity of PVCA-SPE was only about 2.23 × 10−5 S cm−1 at room tempera - ture, adding plasticizers, inorganic ionic conductor or nanopar - ticles, copolymerization would be effective method to improve ionic conductivity of PVCA-based solid polymer electrolyte. It was demonstrated that in ",394

Experimental Section Synthesis of Materials : 1.43 g LiDFOB (Innochem(Beijing) Technology Co., Ltd., 99.9%) was dissolved in to 10 mL VC (Energy Chemica., 99.9%) to get a homogeneous and transparent solution (1.0 m LiDFOB in VC, ≈9.6% (w/w)), then the solution was added 10 mg AIBN (Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd.). The solution was injected into 2032 lithium battery, where cellulose separator was adopted as Supporting Information for polymer electrolyte which separated cathode and anode. Later, the lithium batteries were kept constantly at 60 °C for 24 h and 80 °C for 10 h in hot box to generate the completion of polymerization of VC. The ultimate corresponding loading amount of PVCA-LiDFOB in PVCA-SPE was 0.013 mg cm−2. The obtained PVCA was purified after three cycles of a redissolution– reprecipitation method using dimethylformamide and diethyl ether as a solvent and precipitant, respectively. The calculated polymerization conversion of VC into PVCA was more than 95%. In order to show the picture of PVCA-SPE directly, a piece of cellulose paper with VC liquid electrolyte was sandwiched in between two glass panes. Then, the cellulose paper with VC liquid electrolyte was stored at 60 °C for 24 h and 80 °C for 10 h. A translucent PVCA-SPE was prepared (shown in Figure 1b). In order to get the microstructure of PVCA solid polymer electrolyte, symmetric batteries ",389
test_pdfs/001.pdf,8,3,"stainless steel/PVCA-SPE/stainless steel were fabricated. After heat process, the batteries were disassembled to get the PVCA-SPE. Characterization : The morphology of the PVCA-SPE was investigated by a field emission scanning electron microscopy (Hitachi S-4800 at 5 kV). 1H and 13C spectra of PVCA were recorded on a Bruker AVANCE III 600 MHz with tetramethylsilane as internal reference. Thermogravimetric analysis of PVCA-LiDFOB was carried out on TG 209F1 Iris (NETZSCH). Differential scanning calorimetry of PVCA-LiDFOB was conducted on DSC 200F3 (NETZSCH) from –60 °C to 200 °C. X-ray diffraction data was collected with a Bruker-AXS Microdiffractometer (D8 Advance) using Cu K α radiation ( λ = 1.5406 Å). Infrared spectra measurements were conducted on a Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (Bruker VERTEX 70). Electrochemical Measurements : The ionic conductivities of PVCA-SPE were determined via an AC technique. The electrolyte was sandwiched between two stainless steel. Data were acquired using BioLogic VSP- 300 with an AC voltage amplitude of 10 mV over the frequency range from 0.1 Hz to 1 MHz. The ionic conductivity of polymer electrolyte was calculated by using following equation l SRσ= (2) where l presents the thickness of polymer electrolyte, S is the contact area between electrode and electrolyte, and R corresponds to the bulk resistance of polymer electrode. Cyclic voltammetry and linear sweep voltammetry of PVCA-SPE were tested on a Li/PVCA-SPE/stainless steel cells by impedance spectroscopy at a scanning ra",386

The lithium ion transfer number of PVCA-SPE was calculated from Bruce–Vincent–Evans equation Li+ss ooo ss sstI IVI R VI R() ()=⋅− − (3) where V is the applied polarization voltage, Io and Ro are the initial current and the initial interfacial resistance before polarization, respectively, and Iss and Rss are the steady-state current and the steady- state interfacial resistance after polarization for 10 000 s, respectively. For cell performance tests, the LiCoO 2 cathode was prepared in a conventional casting method, by mixing 80 wt% LiCoO 2, 10 wt% acetylene black, and 10 wt% PVCA. Finally, the specific density of active material on the electrodes was about 1.5 mg cm−2. The galvanostatic charge/discharge tests of coin-type cells (CR2032) were conducted on LAND testing system (Wuhan LAND electronics Co., Ltd.) at 50 °C.

However, the uncontrolled Li dendrite growth in liquid electrolytes still impedes LMBs from au- thentic commercialization. Upgrading the traditional electrolyte system from liquid to solid and quasi-solid has therefore become a key issue for prospective LMBs. From this premise, it is particularly urgent to exploit facile strat- egies to accomplish this goal. We report that commercialized liquid electrolyte can be easily converted into a novel quasi-solid gel polymer electrolyte (GPE) via a simple and efficient in situ gelation strategy, which, in essence, is to use LiPF 6 to induce the cationic polymerization of the ether-based 1,3-dioxolane and 1,2-dimethoxyethane liquid electrolyte under ambient temperature. The newly developed GPE exhibits elevated protective effects on Li anodes and has universality for diversified cathodes including but not restricted to sulfur, olivine-type LiFePO 4, and layered LiNi 0.6Co 0.2Mn 0.2O2, revealing tremendous potential in promoting the large-scale application of fu- ture LMBs. INTRODUCTION Rapid expansion of large-scale electric facilities represented by elec- tri",411
test_pdfs/002.pdf,1,2,"c vehicles, unmanned planes, and smart electrical grids is witnessed during the past few years (1 –3). At the same time, the unprecedented electric energy consumption in modern society has profoundly in-fluenced the prospect of lithium ion batteries (LIBs), where high- energy density is becoming an authentic demand for the days to come (4, 5). Lithium metal batteries (LMBs) consisting of lithium (Li) anodes (3860 mAh g −1) (6, 7), high-energy cathodes (8 –10), and stable electrolytes (11, 12) are among the most motivating re- search territories of lithium secondary batteries (13), but it is also acknowledged that the practical application of LMBs is seriously impeded by uncontrolled Li dendrites and pulverization under liq- uid electrolytes (LEs) commonly used in LIBs (14, 15). Tremendous efforts have been dedicated through many approaches to overcome the above challenges (16–19), among which the exploration of safe and stable electrolytes with compatibility to metallic Li is particular- ly critical and indispensable (20). Today research on gel polymer electrolytes (GPEs) and solid poly- mer electrolytes (SPEs) is receiving extensive interest (16, 21, 22). As the electrolytes for LMBs, they are featured with superior stabil-ities toward Li anodes over traditional LEs, but the interfacial prob- lems of GPEs and SPEs within integrated batteries, especially the separation between cathode materials and electrolytes, need to be further resolved. Although in situ polymerization has been proved by numerous studies to be the effective approach to synthesize GPEs and SPEs with compatible interfaces, most ",363
test_pdfs/002.pdf,1,3,"of the in situ po - lymerization strategies used now are derived from free radical theory that requires the presence of extra nonelectrolytic monomers, initi -ators, and special conditions such as high temperature (22– 24). There is still a lack of productive strategies that can take advantage of the conventional materials for commercialized electrolytes without im- purity introduction and is meanwhile implementable under moder- ate external conditions. It is trustworthy that with such a strategy explored and applied in the battery industries, the general commer- cialization of LMBs based on GPEs and SPEs will be with consider- able feasibility. Herein, a new strategy is crafted to convert traditional ether- based 1,3-dioxolane (DOL) and 1,2-dimethoxyethane (DME) LEs into a novel quasi-solid GPE simply with the addition of commer- cial lithium hexafluorophosphate (LiPF 6). The intriguing chemistry of cationic ring-opening polymerization between LiPF 6 and DOL is for the first time unearthed and used in Li secondary battery systems. Compared to most of the commonly used in situ gelation routines, this strategy is designed with incomparable advantages including commercialized materials, free of impurities, and moderate condi- tions. To the best of our knowledge, it is one of the easiest methods to in situ fabricate polymer-based electrolytes. Derived from the con- ventional electrolyte system but with superior compatibility toward Li anodes, the GPE exhibits enormous potential as a reliable electro- lyte for the next-generation LMBs. In this premise, this novel GPE is successfully applied into a se",355

RESULTS Gelation mechanism of GPEThe in situ gelation process and its mechanism are demonstrated in Fig. 1A. A liquid precursor obtained by mixing DOL/DME LE with a certain amount of LiPF 6 is, in advance, injected into the battery. As revealed in fig. S1 and movie S1, the precursor solution exhibits favorable wettability toward battery components that is comparable with the LE. In addition, the subsequent in situ gelation under am- bient conditions forms a new quasi-solid GPE to fulfill the integrated battery. The chemical mechanism involved can be summed up as the 1Beijing Key Laboratory of Energy Conversion and Storage Materials, College of Chemistry, Beijing Normal University, Beijing 100875, China. 2CAS Key Laboratory of Molecular Nanostructure and Nanotechnology, CAS Research/Education Center for Excellence in Molecular Sciences, Institute of Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100190, China. 3University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049, China. *These authors contributed equally to this work. †Corresponding author.

S2). PF 5 is known as a strong Lewis acid that is also the critical initiator for polymerization (fig. S3) (22, 25), which enables the polymerization to proceed smooth- ly under room temperature. Namely, in the precursor solution, PF 5 combines trace water [12 parts per million (ppm)] to form H+(PF 5OH)−, which induces DOL monomers to convert into the reactive second oxonium ions via fast protonation, and the repeti-tious interposition of DOL monomers into the oxoniu",271

As the polymer grows to a certain degree, trace H 2O would attack the oxonium ions and terminate the cur- rent chain growth with a nucleophilic substitution (fig. S4). High– molecular weight linear-chain polymer polydioxolane (PDXL) is acquired. Consequently, the integrated homogeneous GPE is even- tually established via the combination of the polymer framework (PDXL) with liquid-phase DME. A simulation experiment is exe- cuted to enlarge and visualize the microreactions described above, and the reliability of mechanism is confirmed (fig. S5). The optical photographs in Fig. 1B macroscopically demonstrate the gelation evolution where the original flowable liquid solution of DOL/DME LE and LiPF 6 turns into a gelatinous electrolyte with immovable and stretchy characteristics, indicating that polymerization has taken place within the electrolyte. Furthermore, both the precursor solu-tion and GPE remain uniform and transparent as observed, imply- ing that the generation of the lithium fluoride (LiF) from LiPF 6 decomposition is t",236

To elucidate the structure details of the product, we purified GPE to remove liquid phase and lithium salts leaving only the PDXL. We weighed the acquired PDXL and calculated the poly- merization conversion rate of monomer DOL to be as high as 91.0% (table S1). The PDXL chloroform solution is measured by 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR; Fig. 1C), in which the chemical shift at 3.72 ppm is assigned to the H on group –O–CH 2–CH 2–O– and 4.75 ppm represents for group –O–CH 2–O–. The integral area ratio of 2:1 indicates the same quantity ratio of the above groups, matching well with the structure of –CH 2–O–CH 2–CH 2-O– as the repeating unit (26, 27). The 13C NMR (fig.

The framework of PDXL with an ether bond–rich linear chain struc - ture exhibits prominent ability to deliver Li ion (Li+), which has already been investigated in polymers with similar structures such as polyethylene oxide (28, 29). The transport resistance within GPE is tremendously reduced by the DME liquid phase that combines with the PDXL framework as a plasticizer, which exhibits a signifi - cant influence on the ion conductivity of the GPE as demonstrated in fig. S10 and table S2. Moreover, it is believed that the GPE de - rived from the combination of stable polymer framework and liq - uid DME has much lower volatilization, which is measured to be only one-sixth of the pristine LE (fig. S11). Meanwhile, the melting point of polymer framework can reach 60°C, and the GPE conse- quently shows fine tolerance and reversibility toward the tempera- ture variation during battery formation, as presented in fig. S12. Protective effect on Li metal anodes We assembled symmetrical Li|Li cells with a GPE and a conventional DOL/DME LE to investigate the stability of Li during cycling. Both Li|Li cells are first charged and discharged under a current density of 0.5 mA cm −2 for the area capacity of 1.0 mAh cm−2. As demon- strated in Fig. 2A, the charge and discharge of Li|Li battery with GPE can proceed under a significantly low overpotential that is about 20 mV after the first few cycles of activation. Even after the battery is cycled for approximately 800 hours, the voltage polariza- tion still remains less than 25 mV, exhibiting remarkably stable Li deposition and dissolution behaviors. For the battery with LE, apart from the visi",474
test_pdfs/002.pdf,3,2,"bly elevated initial voltage polarization compared to GPE, the continuously increasing overpotential also implies the nonuniform Li plating/stripping that is exacerbating upon cycling. Thereafter, another test is implemented where the current density is fixed at a larger value of 1.0 mA cm −2 for 1.0 mAh cm−2 (Fig. 2B), and it is remarkable to see that the cycling behavior of battery using GPE can still remain stable for more than 400 hours without obvi- ous voltage polarization variation. On the contrary, the battery with LE undergoes similar polarization enlargement during cycling. The morphologies of Li are observed after cycling under 1.0 mA cm−2. A smooth surface with only a few sporadic coarse sites is maintained for the Li cycled within the GPE (Fig. 2C), where Li dendrites are not shown after cycling. Meanwhile, the cross- sectional image (Fig. 2D) further demonstrates that no pulveriza-tion layer is formed. In sharp contrast, the cycling within LE leaves Li with a predominantly pulverized rough surface (Fig. 2E). The higher magnification confirms the existence of Li dendrites with the typical protruding structure (Fig. 2E, inset), and it could therefore be concluded that the uncontrolled growth of dendrites has resulted in the pulverization of Li surface. Furthermore, the cross-sectional image (Fig. 2F) reveals that the pulverization layer has eroded the Li foil to a depth of more than 50  m. From these results, it can be implied that the instability of Li|Li batteries with LE during cycling is stemmed from the dendrite growth and the consequent pulveri- zation that causes continuous loss of reactive Li. Compared to LE, the GPE has improved interfacial compatibility with Li anodes, and the confinement of a polymer framework to the liquid phase guar- antees less contact between a Li surface and reactive electrolyte components, which effectively reduces the interfacial reactions and promotes the even dispe",427
test_pdfs/002.pdf,3,3,"rsion of Li + on the Li surface (30), leading to an impressive capability to suppress dendrite growth and main-tain stable cycling. Figure S13 further presents the Li-Cu battery tests with GPE and LE, respectively. It is demonstrated by fig. S13A that, without any additives, the initial Coulombic efficiency of the Li-Cu battery with GPE attains 90% at 1 mA cm −2. The efficiency after several cycles reaches above 95%, which can remain stable for at least 100 cycles without obvious decline (fig. S13B). As a comparison, the Li-Cu battery with LE shows a relative low first-cycle Coulombic efficiency of 81%. Although it can also reach beyond 90% for a few cycles, an integral decline evidently exhibits after 20 cycles, which could be attributed to the repetitive breakage and repair of the solid electro- lyte interphase (SEI) layer during Li plating/stripping originating from a more severe corrosion of Li anodes in LE. Furthermore, spe- cific cycles of charging and discharging are demonstrated. It is ob- vious that the curves of the Li-Cu battery with GPE (fig. S13C) can maintain stable overpotential without evident polarization increment. As for the Li-Cu battery with LE presented in fig. S13D, a remark - ably enlarged overpotential is observed from 30 mV in the 10th cycle toward 70 mV in the 50th cycle. These data suggest that replacing LE with GPE could help maintain a more stable SEI layer and higher reversibility of Li plating/stripping reaction. Li-S batteries with GPE The Li-S batteries having high-energy densities are considered promising candidates for future LMBs. However, in the conven- tional LE systems, the cycle performance of Li-S batteries has long been affected by severe polysulfide shuttling and the resultant loss of electrochemical active species. Since the GPE could still be re- garded as an ether-based electrolyte with a unique quasi-solid exis- tence form, it is the seamless alternative to tradition",446
test_pdfs/002.pdf,3,4,"al LE for Li-S batteries with efficacious restriction to polysulfide diffusion and the consequent “shuttle effect.” The GPE is introduced into the Li-S battery through in situ polymerization with a sufficiently infiltrating precursor solution into a sulfur electrode as illustrated in Fig. 3A. After polymerization, we disassembled the battery for scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observation. The originally exposed cathode and separator (Fig. 3, B and C) are evenly covered by GPE (Fig. 3, D and E), and it is notable that the coverage is not only restricted to the surface but also inside the cathode (fig. S14). Such an in situ polymerization process would drastically reduce the contact resis- tance between cathode materials and the electrolyte and realize the rapid transmission of Li +. Significantly, the effect of polymer frame- work as blockage for polysulfide migration is attested by the perme-ation test in Fig. 3F. In this simulation experiment, the polysulfides scarcely exhibit any infiltration in GPE even after 48 hours of place- ment. On the contrary, DOL/DME LE shows no resistance to the diffusion of polysulfides. As further verification, we disassembled Li-S batteries with GPE and LE after 50 cycles of charge/discharge at 0.5 C. It is obvious that the separator in LE turns yellow, while the other one soaked with GPE stays almost in its original color (Fig. 3G), which can be a piece of evidence that polysulfides are sealed within the chamber of the cathode by an in situ formed poly- mer framework. The charge/discharge curves of both GPE and LE batteries are presented in Fig. 4 (A and B). Li-S battery with GPE exhibits a high initial discharge capacity of 1010 mAh g −1 at the rate of 0.5 C (Fig. 4A) due to the superior ionic conductivity and interfacial af-finity of GPE.

Figure 4C depicts that the cyclic voltammogram (CV) profiles of GPE overlap well with each other with two anodic peaks of 2.30 and 2.40 V as well as two cathodic peaks of 2.25 and 2.05 V, which are typical electro- chemical peaks of sulfur, indicating mere oxidation and reduction conversions between sulfur and sulfides without side reactions (31– 33). In comparison, the CV curves of the battery with LE (Fig. 4D) demonstrate the existence of severe shuttle effect, and from the sec - ond cycle, a visible shift of oxidation peaks to higher voltage emerges, indicating detrimentally enlarged polarization that will affect the following battery performances. After 500 cycles at 0.5 C, the capacity of the Li-S battery using GPE remains 741 mAh g −1 with an excellent capacity retention of 73.7% (Fig. 4E). As the measurement extends to 1000 cycles, the battery still maintains half of its initial capacity corresponding to the low decay of only 0.05% per cycle. The Coulombic efficiency retains more than 97.0% throughout the total cycling, figuring fine stability against ultralong cycling trial. Comparatively, the Li-S bat-",310
test_pdfs/002.pdf,5,2," tery with LE undergoes an abrupt capacity decline during the first 300 cycles from 1010 to 370 mAh g −1 and is compelled to cycle under a quite low capacity, which, to the end, is only below 200 mAh g−1. The Coulombic efficiency of less than 85.0% during whole cycling implies an ever-present shuttle effect. Upon cycling, we measured the Nyquist profiles of both batteries, from which it can be observed that the internal resistance remains stable in Li-S battery with GPE (fig. S15A). For the battery with LE (fig. S15B), the resistance in- creases continually, indicating that the soluble polysulfides shuttling recklessly will eventually deposit on the surface of an anode as insol - uble and insulated components, which are responsible for the tougher Li + transport. To further support the results, we investigated the microstructures of Li anodes in Li-S batteries with GPE and LE after 50 cycles at 0.5 C. For Li-S battery with GPE (fig. S15C), the Li surface after cycling is smooth and free of depositions, while in LE (fig. S15D), a large proportion of Li surface is covered by rough sediments. The feather-like depositions (fig. S15D, inset) are further identified as a series of sulfides derived from the side reactions between lithium polysulfides and Li by XP",301

It is also noteworthy that the utilization of GPE benefits Li-S battery with higher self-discharge resistance, which is one of the most im- portant properties in practical application (fig. S17). The discharge process of the battery with GPE is interrupted on the 11th cycling, with the cutoff voltage at 2.05 V where the amount of soluble poly- sulfides is at the highest level (fig. S17, A and B). After 1-week place- ment, the battery restores its foregoing discharge process and exhibits a capacity decay of only 6% compared to the 10th cycle. Notably, in the subsequent cycles, a minor rise in capacity indicates that the activation process also contributes to the capacity decay, which is reversible; thus, the actual capacity degradation derived from self-discharge is even slighter. In contrast, we conducted the same interruption on the battery with LE in fig. S17 (C and D). The recovered discharge process of Li-S battery with LE rapidly terminates with a capacity of only 350 mAh g −1, representing capacity loss as high as 40% that is irreversible.

Cycling stability is also fairly com- pared between the LiFePO 4|GPE|Li battery and the LiFePO 4|LE|Li battery (Fig. 5B). In the final period of cycling at 0.5 C, the LiFePO 4|LE|Li battery exhibits a scattered and reduced capacity and Coulombic efficiency, which arise from the efficiency loss of Li an - odes. By contrast, the LiFePO 4|GPE|Li battery undergoes no obvious fading either in capacity or in Coulombic efficiency, with a capacity retention of 95.6% after 700 cycles and a stable Coulombic efficiency of more than 99.5%, indicating superior interface stability between electrodes and GPE.

test_pdfs/002.pdf,6,2,"of up to 4.30 V is considered a more promising cathode material to meet the demand for high-energy LMBs (37). However, it is well recognized that ether-based DOL/DME LE has seldom taken steps into the territory of layered NCM materials because of its extreme instability and oxidation intention under high voltage. Normally, the DOL/DME LE starts to become unstable when the voltage rises to 4.00 V and undergoes serious decomposition at the voltage of more than 4.20 V (Fig. 6A). This means that, when matching DOL/DME LE with NCM 622 and selecting a typical cutoff voltage of 4.30 V, the battery suffers a severe overcharging phenomenon (Fig. 6B) attributed to massive solvent oxidation and decomposition. Theoretically, the instability of liquid-phase DOL/DME to a large extent originates from the DOL with an unstable cyclic structure (38, 39), which implies that,",201
test_pdfs/002.pdf,6,3," after a ring-opening polymerization process where the cyclic DOL is, in advance, stabilized in the long-chain linear structure, the tol- erance of electrolyte toward electrochemical progress under high voltage could be improved. As proof, the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curve presented in Fig. 6C demonstrates that there are no obvious decomposition currents of GPE until the voltage reaches 4.60 V. Using a cathode of NCM 622 to match the GPE with a voltage limitation of 4.30 V can as well achieve normalized charge and discharge behaviors at the rate of 0.1 C without an oxidation-led overcharging phenomenon (Fig. 6D). Notably, the capacity and Coulombic efficiency retention of an NCM 622|GPE|Li battery for a period of 100 cycles shown in Fig. 6E further prove that these stabili - ties have endurance toward repetitive charges and discharges.

Adv. 2018; 4 : eaat5383 5 October 2018 SCIENCE ADVANCES | RESEARCH ARTICLE8 of 9MATERIALS AND METHODS Synthesis of GPE The GPE was prepared by in situ gelation of a precursor solution in a sealed pellucid glass reagent bottle. The precursor solution consisted of 2 M LiPF 6 dissolved in a common DOL/DME LE, which con- tained 1 M lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) in a mixed organic solution of DOL and DME (1:1 , v/v). The precursor solution spontaneously transformed into GPE by standing for a period of time at room temperature. All processes of preparing the GPE were conducted in an Ar-filled glove box. Separation and purification of PDXL from GPE PDXL was separated and purified as follows. The GPE was dispersed with absolute ethyl alcohol, and then the mixed solution was centri- fuged at 8000 rpm for 5 min. The supernatant fluid was poured out, and lower precipitation was dispersed again with new clean ethanol and centrifuged. The above process was repeated more than five times to separate the white precipitate. The obtained white precipi- tate was dried by natural volatilization at room temperature to re- move redundant ethanol and obtained the isolated polymer named as PDXL. Preparation of cathodes and fabrication of batteries Pure sulfur (analytical reagent, Sigma-Aldrich) was mixed with KB according to the quality ratio of 7:3. The mixtures were then sealed in a glass container and heated at 400°C for 20 hours to make sulfur and KB disperse fully and achieve nanoscale sulfur. The KB/S com- posite was acquired after being naturally cooled to room temperature. The cathode electrodes for Li-S, Li-LiFePO 4, and Li-NCM 622 batteries were fabricated by respectively mixing the KB/S composite, LiFePO 4, and NCM 622 with Super P and polyvinylidene difluoride binder with a weight ratio of 8:1",463
test_pdfs/002.pdf,8,2,":1 via N-methyl-2- pyrrolidone as a solvent. The slurries were immobilized on carbon- coated Al foils and dried for 24 hours in a vacuum oven at 60°, 80°, and 80°C, re-spectively. The sulfur, LiFePO 4, and NCM 622 cathodes were tailored in the diameter of 10 mm with active material loads to be about 1.5, 5.0, and 3.0 mg cm −2. CR2032-type coin cells were assembled in an Ar-filled glove box (H2O < 0.1 ppm, O 2 < 0.1 ppm). The coin cells with GPE were fab- ricated simply by direct in situ polymerization. The Celgard separa-tor was sandwiched between the cathode and Li foil. The precursor solution was injected into the separator, and the batteries were filled with precursor solution. Subsequently, the assembled batteries were left to stand for a period of time to form GPE completely inside the battery. The comparison coin cells were fabricated by the same route except for the usage of the common LE of 1.0 M LiTFSI in DOL/ DME with a volume ratio of 1:1. Characterizations The FTIR spectrum of the prepared PDXL was recorded using SHIMADZU IRAffinity-1 in the range of 400 to 4000 cm −1 to inves- tigate the functional group of PDXL. 1H NMR and 13C NMR spec- tra of PDXL were collected on a Bruker AVANCE III 400 MHz with CDCl 3 as a deuterated solvent and tetramethylsilane as an internal reference to obtain the structure of PDXL. The thermogravimetric analysis of LiPF 6 was measured by an apparatus (Q600 SDT Amer- ica, TA Instruments) from 25° to 350°C. XPS was explored on the Thermo Scientific ESCALab 250Xi (Thermo Fisher Scientific). An Instron 3366 electronic universal testing machine (Instron Corpo-ration) was used in mechanical testing. The contact angle mea- surements were conducted on the Contact Angle Meter (OCA 20, Dataphysics Company). A gel permeation chromatograph (PL-GPC50) was used to measure the molecular weight o",513

Con- trast experiments on volatilization of GPE and LE were designed as follows: The changes in weight of GPE and LE with the same origi- nal weight as time goes on were recorded in an Ar-filled glove box at room temperature. Li 2S8 solution (0.2 M) was prepared as fol- lows: Li 2S and sulfur were added into a glass transparent reagent bottle with DME in accordance with stoichiometric ratio and mixed uniformly by magnetic stirring until the miscible liquid turns to dark brown. Li 2S8 solution (100  l) was dropped into the bottles, in which GPE and LE had the same volume. Electrochemical characterizations The precursor solution of GPE was prepared in a transparent glass bottle, and two stainless steel plates were inserted below the liquid level. The changes in the conductivity of the system, from flexible precursor solution to immobile GPE, were recorded by an electro- chemical workstation (Interface 1000E, Gamry Instruments). The con- ductivity was calculated by the following equation: G = l/(RS), where l is the distance between two stainless steel plates, R is the resistance value, and S is the effective area below the liquid surface. The LSV curves of GPE and LE were obtained by placing the GPE/LE between a stain steel plate and lithium foil at a sweep rate of 1.0 mV s−1. The CVs of batteries with GPE and LE were measured via the electro- chemical workstation (Interface 1000E, Gamry Instruments) in the voltage range of 1.8 to 3.0 V at a scanning rate of 0.05 mV s−1. Elec- trochemical impedance spectra (EIS) of batteries with GPE and LE were tested by the electrochemical workstation (Interface 1000E, Gamry Instruments) in the frequency range of 10−1 to 105 Hz. The Li|GPE|Li and Li|LE|Li symmetric cells were studied using LAND (LANHE CT2",452

The galvanos - tatic charge/discharge tests of batteries, including Li-S batteries, Li- LiFePO 4 batteries, and Li-NCM 622 batteries with GPE and LE were examined using the LAND testing system (LANHE CT2001A).

Introduction Rechargeable lithium-ion batteries have been widely used from digital devices to electric vehicles in modern society.[1] However, due to the limited energy density of electrode materials based on ReseaRch aR ticle In Situ Cross-Linked Plastic Crystal Electrolytes for Wide-Temperature and High-Energy-Density Lithium Metal Batteries Aoxuan Wang, Shouxian Geng, Zhengfei Zhao, Zhenglin Hu,* and Jiayan Luo* The development of high-energy-density lithium metal batteries has been significantly hampered mainly due to the poor electrolyte–electrode compatibility, narrow operating temperature range, and stringent safety concerns of conventional electrolytes. Here, an in situ cross-linked plastic crystal-based electrolyte (CPCE) with an optimized composition design is proposed. Based on the interaction of succinonitrile (SN) and ethoxylated trimethylolpropane triacrylate (ETPTA) with polar carbonyl groups, CPCE delivers well-tuned energy levels and a concentrated coordination structure, leading to an improved electrochemical window and stable electrode– electrolyte interface. In addition, the crystallization of SN molecules is also inhibited, ensuring suitable ion migration in b",273

Moreover, both the nonleakage of cross-linked ETPTA and the nonflammability of the plastic crystal electrolyte (PCE) further reinforce the safety of CPCE. As a result, the well-designed CPCE achieves high ion conductivity with a wide electrochemical window (≈5.4 V vs Li +/Li) and a broad operating temperature range (−20 to 100 °C). It also delivers dendrite-free lithium plating with high Coulombic efficiency of up to ≈99.1%. The Cu|CPCE|LiNi 0.8Co0.1Mn 0.1O2 anode-free pouch cell exhibits high energy density (≈1520 Wh L−1) and high safety during abuse tests. This study paves a new pathway to realize the practical application of high-energy-density lithium metal battery energy storage systems. DOI: 10.1002/adfm.202201861A. Wang, S. Geng, Z. Zhao, Z.

[2] Lithium metal anodes are considered the Holy Grail among the candidate anode materials because of their ultrahigh specific capacity (3860 mAh g –1) and ultralow redox potential (- 3.04 V vs Li+/Li).[3] Nonethe- less, troublesome obstacles metal lithium usually faces still hinder the practical application of rechargeable lithium metal batteries, mainly caused by the employ-ment of unsatisfactory electrolytes. [4] Currently, neither commercial car - bonate nor ether electrolytes are suitable for lithium metal batteries. Specifically, inhomogeneous lithium-ion deposi- tion from carbonate electrolytes results in uncontrolled dendritic growth, which significantly reduces the battery’s cycling life or even leads to short circuits. [5] More- over, the limited electrochemical window of ether electrolytes (<4 V) precludes the development of high-energy-density lithium metal batteries.[6] Additionally, both of them are prone to leakage and flammability, which increases the safety hazards of lithium metal batteries and even electronic devices in practical applications. [7] To advance the practical usage of rechargeable lithium metal batteries, significant effor",254
test_pdfs/003.pdf,1,4,"ts have been undertaken to develop eligible electrolyte systems. The ideal electrolyte for practical lithium metal batteries needs to possess the following merits: First, high safety without risks of leakage and combustion; second, advanced temperature tolerance with favorable ion con-ductivity and thermodynamic stability to the electrode over a wide temperature range; third, ability to achieve a high-energy- density system with a wide electrochemical window and robust interfacial contact with high-loading cathodes. [8] However, among various candidates, the most explored solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) constantly suffer from poor oxidative or reductive stability and unacceptable dynamics. [9] Meanwhile, the application of inorganic ceramic electrolytes is hindered by their brittleness, complicated procedures, and poor elec- trode-electrolyte interface contact.[10] It is noteworthy that due to its appropriate ionic conductivity and broad electrochemical window, the solid-state plastic crystal electrolyte (PCE) based on succinonitrile (SN) is considered another potential system.[11] The ORCID identification number(s) for the author(s) of this article can be found under https://doi.org/10.1002/adfm.202201861.

[12] Additionally, PCE benefits from the properties of nonflammability and nonvolatility, which makes it an attractive matrix in solid electrolytes. [11d,13] Regrettably, the poor reductive stability of SN molecules usually causes irreversible interface corrosion of active lithium metal with severely reduced cycling life, which will become particularly intense at high temperatures (such as 100 °C). [14] Moreover, SN molecules tend to exhibit increased crystallinity and viscosity at low temperatures, which seriously weakens the ionic conductivity of the whole system (Figure S1, Supporting Information). Moreover, solvent-free PCE usually delivers unde-sirable wettability to electrode mat",196

Therefore, to date, PCE has merely been used as the cathode/electrolyte interface layer or the electrolyte for lith-ium-ion batteries, which fail to gain wide practical application in rechargeable lithium metal systems. [15] In light of this, to expand the PCE into a high-performance electrolyte for lithium metal batteries, we present in this work an in situ crosslinked plastic crystal-based electrolyte (CPCE, Figure 1) that can simultaneously feature the above- mentioned merits, leading to a promising high-energy-density battery system with superior safety and temperature toler - ance behavior. PCE formed by a dual lithium salt (lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide, LiTFSI, and lithium difluoro(oxalato)borate, LiDFOB) and SN can serve as an effi-cient ion transport medium in CPCE and provide it with excellent positive el",213

Ethoxylated trimethylolpropane triacrylate (ETPTA), a robust polymer monomer with high polar groups on the chain segments, is compounded with PCE via an in situ crosslinking polymerization reaction (Figure S2, Supporting Information). Each ETPTA monomer contains three carboxyl groups and can effectively interact with SN, leading to a high percentage of anchored SN. This anchoring design enabled by polar polymer molecules dramatically improves the stability of SN to lithium metal, especially under high-temperature condi-tions. The comparative study reveals that the polymer without high polarity functional groups (e.g., polyethylene oxide, PEO, Figure S3, Supporting Information) could only act as a cosol- vent, increasing the content of free SN and thus exacerbating the side reactions of the lithium metal anode. Meanwhile, due to the reduced crystallinity of SN with electrostatic ad",197

In addition to eliminating the risk of electrolyte leakage, in situ crosslinking of the ETPTA-containing precursor exhibits robust interfa-cial contact, especially with high-loading cathodes. To further reinforce the electrode-electrolyte interface, a certain amount of fluorinated additive (fluoroethylene carbonate, FEC) is also added. In addition to fast lithium-ion transport kinetics with high conductivity (1.08 mS cm –1 at 40 °C) and lithium-ion transference number of 0.64, the as-developed CPCE exhibits excellent lithium plating/stripping reversibility on a lithium anode with a high Coulombic efficiency of ≈99.1%, which is Figure 1.

Mean- while, the interaction between ETPTA and SN molecules also leads to the high voltage stability of CPCE with a wide elec- trochemical window (5.4 V vs Li/Li +), which makes it suitable for high-energy-density batteries. It turns out that CPCE-based lithium metal symmetric cells and high-voltage full cells with a high-loading cathode can achieve stable cycling from - 20 to 100 °C. The merits of CPCE enable negligible capacity degra- dation in the thin Li (50 µm)|CPCE|LiCoO 2 (LCO, 11 mg cm–2 each side) pouch cell (0.15 Ah) for 30 cycles and anode-free Cu|CPCE|LiNi 0.8Mn 0.1Co0.1O2 (NMC811, 21 mg cm–2 each side) pouch cell (0.3 Ah) at the practical application level with an ultrahigh volumetric energy density of ≈1520 Wh L –1, both of which are among the state-of-the-art performances.[16] 2. Results and Discussion 2.1. Electrochemical and Thermal Stability Analysis of CPCE In this work, the SN-LiTFSI-LiDFOB-based dual lithium salt PCE was selected due to the high dissociation ability of LiTFSI and the excellent film-forming property of LiDFOB. The LiDFOB with low solubility was fixed at a saturation con- tent relative to SN (LiDFOB: SN = 1/15 wt), and then dual-salt PCE possessing different mole ratios of LiTFSI: SN (5:95, 10:90, 15:85, 20:80, 25:75) can be obtained. Then, equal amounts of ETPTA and FEC (1/5 wt relative to SN, respectively) were added. After that, in situ polymerization was initiated by azobi- sisobutyronitrile (AIBN) during the heating process for hours. These as-prepared samples were denoted 5PCE, 10PCE, 15PCE, 20PCE, and 25PCE. As shown in Fig",520
test_pdfs/003.pdf,3,2,"ure S4 (Supporting Infor - mation), the disappearance of the CC peak (1635 cm –1 and 1619 cm–1) belonging to unpolymerized ETPTA after the heating process indicates complete polymerization of the ETPTA monomer. [17] Temperature-dependent ion conductivity for the samples mentioned above was also measured, indicating that the 15PCE sample exhibits the highest lithium-ion conduc- tivity (1.08 mS·cm –1 at 40 °C) over a wide temperature range, which has been selected for subsequent tests and abbreviated CPCE (Figure S5a, Supporting Information, and Figure 2a). The temperature-dependent ionic conductivity of CPCE follows Arrhenius behavior, indicative of a low activation energy (E a) of 0.21 eV for lithium-ion transport (Figure S5b, Supporting Infor - mation). This low E a approached the level of the typical liquid commercial electrolyte 1 M LiPF 6-EC/DEC (LCE, 0.23 eV), which is much better than that of the SPE reported before (PEO, 0.65 eV), demonstrating the fast lithium-ion transport kinetics of CPCE. [18] In addition to the thermodynamic factors discussed above, another critical merit for electrolytes is the lithium-ion trans-ference number (t Li+).[19] Benefitting from the higher t Li+ (0.64, Figure 2b) than LCE (0.29, Figure S6, Supporting Informa-tion), CPCE is able to achieve higher power densities and swifter charging processes. Such a high t Li+ value of CPCE is primarily due to the effectively inhibited migration of anions in the polymer matrix, resulting in improved concentration polarization and rate performance for lithium metal batteries. To determine the oxidative stability of CPCE, a linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) test was applied at room temperature. As shown in Figure 2c, CPCE exhibit",428
test_pdfs/003.pdf,3,3,"s excellent oxidation stability (up to 5.4 V vs Li/Li +), which is favorable for matching high- voltage cathodes and achieving high-energy-density lithium metal batteries. In addition, cyclic voltammetry (CV) tests were conducted to test the reductive stability of CPCE at the lithium metal anode interface. To analyze the effect of ETPTA, an equal mass fraction of PEO without polar groups was employed to replace ETPTA to prepare the comparative sample (gelatinized plastic crystal electrolyte, abbreviated GPCE). CV tests of Li| SS cells reveal that the peak current density for GPCE declined rapidly during the 50 cycles (Figure S7, Supporting Informa-tion), which is mainly due to the side-reactions of SN mole- cules with plated active lithium, leading to increased inter - face impedance. In stark contrast, the peak current density in CPCE exhibits only negligible change, proving its enhanced thermodynamic stability with lithium metal (Figure 2d). Ben- efitting from higher lithium plating/stripping reversibility with suppressed side reactions, the Li| CPCE| Cu cell exhibits a smooth voltage curve and lower nucleation overpotential with an average Coulombic efficiency of up to ≈ 99.1% (Figure 2e), which is higher than that of the Li| GPCE| Cu cell (Figures S8). Furthermore, it is worth noting that even at 100 °C, the Cou- lombic efficiency of the Li| CPCE| Cu cell can still be main- tained at ≈ 97 .1% (Figures S9). Moreover, the lithium metal deposited on copper in the Li| CPCE| Cu cell delivers a smooth and compact morphology (Figures S10), which provides a solid foundation for the improved performance of CPCE-based lithium metal batteries. Notably, the low current den- sity during long-period cycling wil",398
test_pdfs/003.pdf,3,4,"l enlarge the potential interfacial side reactions of Li| Li symmetric cells. Therefore, it is an effective method to test the thermodynamic stability of electrolytes to lithium metal anodes. Unsurprisingly, the Li|GPCE| Li symmetric cell shows apparent voltage fluctua- tions and fails to work prematurely only after 7 cycles during the galvanostatic charge–discharge (GCD, Figure S11, Sup-porting Information) test at room temperature. In contrast, the Li| CPCE| Li symmetric cell delivers favorable interface sta- bility with a smooth voltage profile and an operating time of more than 300 h (Figure 2f). In addition to basic electrochemical properties, the thermal stability of CPCE is also critical for the practical application of lithium metal batteries. Thermogravimetric (TG) curves and flame tests (Figure 2g,h) demonstrate that CPCE loses just 5% of its pristine weight at 168 °C and cannot be ignited even in contact with the flame for several seconds, showing low vapor pressure and nonflammability properties. Furthermore, even after heating CPCE with a delithiated LiCoO 2 cathode (charged to 4.3 V) to 140 °C, there is still no obvious weight loss, dem- onstrating its enhanced safety performance under the condi- tion of practical application. In contrast, severe mass loss can easily be detected in 1,3-dioxolane (DOL)-based solid-state elec-trolytes, usually accompanied by formaldehyde gas and other epoxides with low boiling points. [20] Similarly, flammable LCE also evaporates rapidly even at ambient temperature due to the low boiling points of carbonate solvents and is easily ignited, leading to potential application risks (Figures S12 and S13, Sup- porting Information).

[17b,21] Generally, such a strengthened interaction can increase the bond length of the functional group, leading to a decrease in wavenumbers and vice versa. [22] Therefore, an anchoring effect is logically proposed between SN molecules and the carbonyl group segments of ETPTA, which can dramati- cally improve the electrochemical performance of CPCE.In addition to experimental characterization, theoretical cal- culations were further introduced to investigate the internal interactions of CPCE.

To quantitatively compare the coordination of different systems, density functional theory (DFT) was also applied to calculate the binding energy of geometric configu- ration optimized systems. As shown in Figure 3c, the binding energy between ETPTA and SN is - 0.47 eV.

As shown in the 13C NMR spectra (Figure 3e), the peak of cyanogenic carbon belonging to SN in CPCE exhibits more significant displacement upfield than in GPCE, indicating the increased proportion of anchoring-SN in CPCE with the aid of ETPTA. This result was also verified by FTIR spectroscopy and the corresponding statis-tics bar chart (Figure 3f, g), where the signals at 2258 cm –1 and 2281 cm–1 represent free-SN and anchored-SN, respectively. The percentage of the integral area of the two peaks shows that the anchoring effect of SN molecules strengthens with increasing LiTFSI. Notably, the proportion of anchored-SN in CPCE is similar to that of the 25-LiTFSI/SN sample with a high LiTFSI concentration, far exceeding that in GPCE. Rather than diluting the electrolyte system such as the conventional polymer PEO, the addition of ETPTA with polar groups shows a significant anchoring effect to SN molecules, which reduces the propor - tion of free SN and achieves a concentrated coordination struc-ture. It is noted that the higher content of anchored SN in CPCE than in GPCE can effectively enhance the reductive sta- bility of SN molecules and the oxidative stability of ETPTA. In summary, the interactions between ETPTA and SN can be illus-trated in Figure 3h, in which the hydrogen atoms of CH 2 in SN molecules are strongly attracted to the electronegative oxygen atoms of CO in the highly branched poly(ETPTA), leading to a coordinated supramolecular structure rather than simply mixing. This network with a coordination structure ",428
test_pdfs/003.pdf,6,2,"can effectively inhibit the movement of SN and homogenize its electrostatic potential, thus preventing SN from directly contacting and reacting with lithium metal. Furthermore, ion transport at low temperatures and interfacial stability at high temperatures are both guaranteed by this anchoring effect, which promotes the performance of CPCE-based lithium metal batteries over a wide temperature range. Therefore, an effective strategy is proposed to design high-performance plastic crastal-based electrolytes by enhancing molecular interactions through the targeted introduction of ETPTA molecules with highly polar groups, which is helpful to promote the application of high-energy-density lithium metal batteries. 2.3. Application of CPCE in Lithium Metal Batteries The electrochemical performance of CPCE was initially evalu- ated by Li|CPCE|Li symmetric cells. Enhanced lithium plating/stripping reversibility was maintained even at a high cur - rent density of 1 mA cm –2 and an extremely harsh condition of 100 °C (Figure S16, Supporting Information). In addition, statistical results from recent reports on in situ polymerized electrolytes show that symmetric cells using CPCE achieve the highest levels of cycle life (>4800 h) and critical current den-sity (4 mA cm –2, Figures S17 and S18 and Table S1, Supporting Information). Smooth and dendrite-free deposition morphology is also observed from both microscopic and macroscopic char - acterization (Figures S19 and S20, Supporting Information). In situ polymerization strategies possess the merit of excellent interfacial compatibility.

There- fore, the Li|CPCE|LCO full cell exhibits outstanding cycling sta-bility compared to GPCE (Figures 4c), with a capacity retention of ≈94.2% even after 300 cycles. A favorable rate performance can also be obtained with a specific capacity of 146 mAh g –1 at a rate of 1 C, much higher than that of the Li|GPCE|LCO cell (Figures 4d). To extend the CPCE to anode-free lithium- metal cells, Cu|CPCE|LCO full cells were also assembled with copper foil (6 µm) and a commercial high cathode active mate- rial loading LCO cathode (≈11 mg cm–2). As the volume of full cells has been minimized without an additional lithium source, the CPCE electrolyte shows excellent potential to meet the demand for high volumetric energy density devices. How- ever, since the lithium metal plated on copper foil is supplied entirely by the lithiated cathode, the capacity loss caused by side reactions and “dead” lithium will be more pronounced. [25] Due to the stable interface and dendrite-free deposition mor - phology, the capacity retention of the Cu|CPCE|LCO cell is up to 83.6% after 50 cycles (Figure 4e), which is much higher than that of the Cu|GPCE|LCO cell (27 .5% after 25 cycles). To verify the applicability of CPCE in existing lithium-ion batteries, graphite|CPCE|LCO full cells were further assembled with commercial high-loading electrodes (≈11 mg cm –2 LCO, N/P rati",444
test_pdfs/003.pdf,6,4,"o = 1.1), which delivered good cycling stability at 0.1 C with ≈97 .3% capacity retention after 70 cycles (Figure S21, Supporting Information). Moreover, when CPCE was applied to a lithium metal full cell matched with a high loading LiNi 0.6Co0.2Mn 0.2O2 (NCM622) cathode (≈21.6 mg cm–2), ≈88.6% of the initial capacity was maintained after 40 cycles at 0.2 C (Figure S22, Supporting Information). Notably, because of the high ionic conductivity and tem- perature tolerance of CPCE, the corresponding full cells have been further evaluated under extremely harsh working con-ditions. To reveal the ability of CPCE under practical condi- tions, the long-term cycle under the wide-temperature range of Li|CPCE|LiNi 0.8Co0.15Al0.05O2 (NCA) full cells with high cathode active material loading (11 mg cm–2) was further tested (Figure 4f, g). Notably, a discharge capacity of 1.7 mAh cm–2 (corresponding to a specific capacity of 154.5 mAh g–1) can still be maintained at a rate of 0.1 C at - 20 °C. Moreover, the discharge specific capacity of the full cell at 0.1 C can reach 2.21 mAh cm–2 (221 mAh g–1) under an operating temperature of 100 °C, mainly due to the reduced impedance with rapid ion transport and outstanding interfacial stability of CPCE even at high temperatures. In sharp contrast, the Li|GPCE|NCA without the SN-anchoring effect exhibits evidently increased polarization at -20 °C, lowering the average discharge voltage and causing the deliverable capacity to fade from 1.2 mAh cm –2 (109.1 mAh g–1) to 0.9 mAh cm–2 (81.8 mAh g–1) after 10 cycles. The increased polarization of Li|GPCE|NCA should be attrib-uted to the uninhibited crystallization tendency of SN in GPCE at low temperatures, which impairs the efficient transport of Adv. Funct.

There is virtually no capacity loss, and the Coulombic efficiency can be maintained at nearly 100% during charge–discharge cycling (Figure 5a). To better evaluate the suitability of CPCE for practical high nickel cath- odes, the Li (50 µm)|CPCE|NCM622 (≈21 mg cm–2 each side) pouch cell with a total capacity ",172

As expected, the long-cycling pouch cell exhibits excellent capacity retention (≈92.6% after 20 cycles at 0.2 C, Figure 5b) and high Coulombic efficiency. An anode-free pouch cell using an industrial bilateral high loading LiNi 0.8Co0.1Mn 0.1O2 (NCM811) cathode (21 mg cm–2 each side) and ultrathin copper foil (6 µm) was constructed to pursue the limit of the volumetric energy density under prac- tical conditions. The voltage curves prove that the as-assembled Cu|CPCE|NCM811 pouch cell (300 mAh) achieves stable cycling over a wide temperature range (Figure 5c) from room Figure 4. a) Schematic illustration showing the in situ cross-linking of CPCE in",191

The corresponding volumetric energy density depending on the discharge capacity can reach up to 1520 Wh L–1 (the internal structure and calculation parameters of the pouch cell are shown in Figure S24 and Table S2, Sup-porting Information), which is an ideal value for incoming practical lithium metal batteries. The initial open-circuit voltage of the Cu|CPCE|NCM811 pouch cell is 0.77 V (Figure 5d).

Conclusion In summary, our work demonstrates an in situ crosslinked plastic crystal-based electrolyte with high safety and wide-temperature operational properties for high-energy-density lithium metal batteries due to its efficient ion transport and reinforced interface compatibility. First, the anchoring effect between crosslinked ETPTA and SN molecules is elucidated, which leads to a well-tuned energy level and a concentrated coordination structure, thus broadening the electrochemical window and ensuring the stability of the electrode interface. Second, this intermolecular interaction also inhibits the crys-tallization of SN, which guarantees the service capability of CPCE ov",164
test_pdfs/003.pdf,8,3,"er a broad temperature range. Third, both the non-leakage of crosslinked ETPTA and the nonflammability of the plastic crystal electrolyte further reinforce the safety of CPCE. The well-designed CPCE spontaneously features high-voltage stability with a wide electrochemical window (≈5.4 V vs Li +/Li) and fast lithium-ion transport kinetics with high conductivity (1.08 mS cm –1 at 40 °C). In addition, the high reversibility of lithium plating/stripping is also proven by the dendrite-free lithium deposition morphology and the high Coulombic effi- ciency (≈99.1%) of the Li|Cu cell. These features enable the ultralong cycling life (>4800 h) and wide operational tempera-ture (-20 to 100 °C) of Li|CPCE|Li and high-voltage full cells. Furthermore, the favorable behavior of lithium metal (0.15 Ah) pouch cell and high-energy-density (≈1520 Wh L –1) anode-free pouch cell (0.3 Ah) under",227

It is expected that the CPCE design will provide deep insight to realize the practical application of high safety and high-energy-density lithium metal batteries.

Experimental Section Preparation of Different Plastic Crystal-based Electrolytes: Lithium difluoro(oxalato)borate (LiDFOB, 98%, Heowns) was continuously added to succinonitrile (SN, 99%, Alladin) until saturation at 60 °C, at which point the mass ratio of LiDFOB to SN was 1/15. Then, lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI, AR, DuoDuo Chem) was added with different molar ratios of LiTFSI:SN (5:95, 10:90, 15:85, 20:80, 25:75). Then, fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC, 99.95%, DuoDuo Chem) and ethoxylated trimethylolpropane triacrylate (ETPTA, average Mw ≈ 693, Alladin) were added to the above system based on the 20% mass of SN. After that, 0.5 wt.% 2,2′-azobis(2-methylpropionitrile) (AIBN, 99.5%, Alladin) as an initiator was added to the precursor. After mixing well at room temperature, the obtained homogeneous precursor was heated at 60 °C for 2 h and 80 °C for 6 h for complete polymerization. The samples were denoted 5PCE, 10PCE, 15PCE, 20PCE, and 25PCE. Subsequently, the 15PCE sample with the highest lithium-ion conductivity was abbreviated CPCE. The comparative sample GPCE was prepared by replacing ETPTA with an equal mass of PEO (average Mw ≈ 100 000, Alladin) in CPCE, and then a homogeneous gel was obtained by thorough mixing at 60 °C. All of the above procedures were conducted in an argon-filled glove box with moisture/oxygen concentrations below 0.01 ppm. Preparation of LiTFSI/SN Samples for FTIR Characterization: The samples for FTIR characterization were prepared by mixing LiTFSI and SN in molar ratios of 5:95, 10:90, 15:85, 20:80, and 25:75 and then stirred at 60 °C until fully dissolved. The samples were named 5-LiTFSI/SN, 10-LiTFSI/SN, 15-LiTFSI/SN, and 25-LiTFSI/SN according to the molar fraction of LiTFSI in the corresponding samples. All of the above sample prepara",601

Preparation of NCA Cathode and LCO Cathode: The active material, Super P, and poly(vinyl difluoride) (PVDF) binder with a weight ratio of 8:1:1 were mixed in N-1-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP). The obtained homogeneous slurry was coated on Al foil (10 µm) followed by vacuum drying at 80 °C for 24 h. The cathodes were punched into 1.13 cm 2 disks. The active material loadings of the as-prepared NCA cathode and LCO cathode were 10–11 mg cm –2 and 2.5 mg cm–2, respectively. Fabrication of Coin Cells and the Anode-free Pouch Cell: (1) All coin cells used for electrochemical tests were obtained by injecting the corresponding electrolyte precursor into the cells during the assembly stage and then heating at 60 °C for 2 h and 80 °C for 6 h for complete polymerization. (2) A bicell-type pouch cell with a capacity of 0.3 Ah was fabricated. The dimensions of the copper foil, high compaction density NCM811 cathode, and PP separator (Celgard 3501) were 62 mm × 65 mm, 57 mm × 62 mm, and 67 mm × 68 mm, respectively. All the electrodes and electrolyte sheets were stacked and packed into an aluminum-plastic film. After injecting CPCE precursor into the aluminum-plastic film, it was sealed and transferred into a pressurized test set. Then, the cell was heated at 60 °C for 2 h and 80 °C for 6 h to gain an anode-free pouch cell with CPCE. Characterization: The morphology of the samples was characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, Hitachi S4800). In situ optical microscopy studies were performed in a homemade electrochemical cell with a transparent window, where CPCE precursor thermally in situ polymerized and then used for observing the process of Li deposition by optical microscopy (RX50 M). The thermal polymerization reaction of ETPTA and species of SN wa",480

The thermal characteristics of different electrolytes were evaluated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA, NETZSCH STA 449 F3/F5) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSSC, TA Q200) under the protection of argon. Electrochemical Measurements: Electrochemical measurements were conducted by using CR2032 coin cells or pouch cells. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), cyclic voltammetry (CV), and lithium-ion transference number (t Li+) were conducted on an electrochemical station (Solartron Metrology, Britain). The ionic conductivity of the different electrolytes was evaluated from -20 °C to 100 °C via EIS in stainless steel|tainless steel (SS) cells from 10 6 Hz to 0.1 Hz. The electrochemical stability of the different electrolytes was studied via the LSV method in Li|SS cells, and the voltage was increased from 3.0 to 6.0 V versus Li/Li + at a scanning rate of 1 mV s–1. The CV measurements of full cells were carried out in Li|SS cells and cycled 50 times between - 0.5 and 2.5 V vs Li/Li + at a scanning rate of 10 mV s–1. The t Li+ of CPCE was measured by DC polarization and AC impedance based on the following Equation (1). tIV IR IV IRLiss ssss() ()=∆− ∆−+00 0 (1) ΔV is the polarization voltage of 10 mV. The initial current I 0, steady current Iss, initial interfacial resistance R 0, and steady interfacial resistance Rss were measured by DC polarization and AC impedance. Galvanostatic charge–discharge (GCD) and Coulombic efficiency measurements were carried out in a battery test system (LAND-CT2001A, China). The coulombic efficiency of lithium plating and stripping cycles was studied via the method of Zhang et al. (https://doi.org/10.1002/aenm.2017",503

A given amount of charge (Q T = 5 mAh) was used to deposit lithium onto the Cu current collector as a lithium source, and then a certain number (n = 99) of cycles at a smaller charge (Q c) was conducted between the lithium electrode and the lithium source. After 99 cycles, the remaining lithium source was completely stripped to the cutoff voltage (1 V). The quantity of lithium source remaining was determined by measuring the final stripping charge (Q s). The average CE over n cycles can be calculated according to Equation (2): CEavgnQ Q nQ Qcs cT=+ + (2) The volumetric energy density of the anode-free lithium metal battery was calculated according to Equation (3): = / vEU ItV avec ell (3) where Uave is the average potential of the discharge curves, I is the current density, t is the time of discharge, and V cell is the volume of the cell, including the cathode, Al current collector, Cu foil, electrolyte, and package of aluminum plastic film (if necessary). Computational Simulation: All density functional theory (DFT) calculations were carried out by using the Gaussian 09 W program. Geometric configurations were optimized at the B3LYP-D3 level with a 6–31+G (d,p) basis set under gas-phase conditions. The ESP surfaces were drawn with an isovalue of 0.001. The binding energy (E b) was calculated by the following Equation (4): EE EE bP SP S =− − + (4) EP+S is the total energy of ETPTA, PEO, and SN with coordinated SN, E P is the total energy of ETPTA, PEO, and SN, and E S is the total energy of SN.

Such reactive anodes necessitate the discovery of compatible electrolyte materials to support the safe and long-term cycling of the devices. Polymer electrolytes (PEs) are now accepted as an enabler of the ultimate solid-state high-performance batteries 1–4, thanks to their great advantages in suppressing both the explosion risk and uncon - trollable dendrite formation, in addition to their high thermal and electrochemical stabilities and advantages in fabrication. The earliest PEs based on polyethylene oxide (PEO) and its copo - lymers have been extensively studied5–9. The key challenges associ - ated with those PEs are to achieve high ionic conductivity (σ ) and high Li+ transference number (tLi) simultaneously, and the stable cycling of solid-state batteries6. Those materials normally have low conductivities or lower tLi (~0.2), which are intrinsically related to their structures (for example, strong coordination of metal ions with pola",366
test_pdfs/004.pdf,1,2,"r groups in polymer backbones) 10–12. A variety of polymer design strategies have been proposed to improve metal ion transport and transference number. For example, the introduction of loosely coordinating repeat units (for example, polycarbonates, polyesters or poly(tetrahydrofuran)) can enhance Li + or Na+ migration, with high transference numbers (> 0.5) achieved12–16. Designing new anion chemistries with restricted motions also can increase the Li+ trans - ference number17. Using block copolymers or crosslinking polymer chains is another way to improve ionic conductivities18. Aside from those methods, the search for new polymer materials with higher metal ion transference numbers and conductivities is ongoing. One approach to maximize the metal ion transference number is to use polyanionic materials, in which anions are chemically bonded to polymer backbones, and cation (for example, Li +) con - duction dominates so that the cation transference number tends to unity19. This situation is highly desirable in batteries to overcome problems related to anion concentration gradients. Despite prog - ress, such single-ion conductors still typically suffer from very low ionic conductivities that hinder their application 20. Recently, cationic PEs named polymeric ionic liquids (PolyILs)21, in which the monomer is a polymerizable ionic liquid cation, have emerged as potential solid-state solvents for lithium salts and shown good performance 22,23. This material inherits both the excellent electrochemical performance of ionic li",329
test_pdfs/004.pdf,1,3,"quids and the good thermal and mechanical properties of polymers24,25. Interestingly, due to a unique Li–anion–polycation co-coordination structure26, the ionic conductivity of these materials increases with increasing salt con - centrations26, which is very different from conventional PEs. This positive relationship is in line with the ‘polymer-in-salt’ electro - lytes27–29 proposed by C. Austen Angell decades ago. In such electro - lytes, once the salt is the dominant component, the ion mobility will begin to increase again while the glass transition temperature (T g) decreases27. However, the PolyIL is unique in that this positive rela - tionship is also applicable to the low salt concentration range, and high conductivities and high t Li have been obtained simultaneously in PolyIL-in-salt (PolyIL-IS)26. Recent computational research suggested a vehicular Li+ diffu - sion mechanism in PolyIL electrolytes that, however, focused on a low to medium salt concentration range (that is, Li +/polycation unit ≤ 0.4)30. This mechanism is likely to be concentration depen - dent because the salt concentration will alter the Li+ coordina - tion environment and thus its transport as demonstrated in liquid electrolytes 31–37.

Materials that meet the simul- taneous requirement of high ionic conductivity and high transference number remain a challenge, in particular for new battery chemistries beyond lithium such as Na, K and Mg. Herein, we demonstrate the versatility of a polymeric ionic liquid (PolyIL) as a polymer solvent to achieve this goal for both Na and K. Using molecular simulations, we predict and elucidate fast alkali metal ion transport in PolyILs through a structural diffusion mechanism in a polymer-in-salt environment, facilitating a high metal ion transference number simultaneously. Experimental validation of these computationally designed Na and K polymer electro- lytes shows good ionic conductivities up to 1.0 × 10 −3 S cm−1 at 80 °C and a Na+ transference number of ~0.57. An electrochemi- cal cycling test on a Na∣2:1 NaFSI/PolyIL∣Na symmetric cell also demonstrates an overpotential of 100 mV at a current density of 0.5 mA cm−2 and stable long-term Na plating/stripping performance of more than 100 hours. PolyIL-based polymer-in-salt strategies for new solid-state electrolytes thus offer an alternative route to design high-performance next-generation sustain-able battery chemistries.

test_pdfs/004.pdf,2,1,"Articles Nature MaterialsThus, in this work, we present a computational design of PolyIL-IS electrolytes, investigating the transport of Na+ and K+. We discov - ered a rapid diffusion of alkali metal ions through a structural dif - fusion mechanism. Under the premise of weak interaction between metal ions and anions, the salt-concentrated environment favours fast metal ion diffusion at 80 °C. We also investigated the diffusion of the multivalent Mg 2+ in these PolyIL-IS systems and discussed the challenges in achieving high Mg2+ conduction. Finally, as a proof of concept, we validated the computational findings by experimen - tal measurement. In the preliminary test of a Na-based PolyIL-IS electrolyte (with mechanical reinforcement), we showed high ionic conductivities and excellent stable cycling behaviour in a sodium symmetric cell. Thus, this solid, solvent-free PolyIL-IS opens up an avenue for developing safer high-energy-density batteries. Computational design of optimal Polyil -is systems The PolyIL studied in this work is poly(diallyldimethylammonium) bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (PDADMA FSI; Supplementary Fig. 1e). Our previous work has studied this polymer with the LiFSI salt 26. Careful experimental measurements of various polycation/Li ratios from 2:1 to 1:6 have determined the ratio to achieve the optimum conductivity, which is 1:1.5. However, such an approach to electro - lyte design is both time consuming and costly, and here we sought a more efficient computational approach to design the Na, K and Mg systems. Based on our earlier molecular dynamics (MD) sim - ulations of Li systems, the optimal 1:1.5 ratio allows the most Li+ to be homogeneously distributed around PDADMA backbones by co-coordinating with anions. At higher Li + ratios, molten salt-like aggregates form, which are shown in silico to enhance Li+ diffu - sion. However, in experiments, these aggregates eventually trans - form into the less conductive crystalline phases, which are slow to form, and thus, this final stable state is far from attainable within the MD simulation timescale. Nevertheless, based on these understand - ings, we hypothesi",479
test_pdfs/004.pdf,2,2,"ze here that a close-to-optimal salt concentra - tion could at least be identified from a PolyIL-IS composition that gives the ‘saturated’ metal ion distribution around polymer chains. This can be determined via quantifying three anion coordination states (Fig. 1a): (1) polycation–anion coordination (P +–A–) as seen in neat PolyIL or with low salt concentrations; (2) metal ion–anion coordination (Me+–A–) as seen in the molten salt-like regime; and (3) polycation–anion–metal ion co-coordination (P+–A––Me+). The coordination of two ions is determined by measuring their distance, which should be less than the first prominent valley distance in their radial distribution function (RDF; explained in Supplementary Fig. 2, Supplementary Table 1 and Supplementary Note 1). For the Na system, two cation ratios of 1:2 and 1:4 were first sim - ulated at 353 K (termed Na12 and Na14). The 1:2 was chosen as it is close to the optimal ratio of the Li system and Na+ also coordinates with a slightly higher number of FSI– than Li+. The higher salt ratio of 1:4 was also examined. The snapshots in Fig. 1b show the selected structures of the two equilibrated Na systems, which present the FSI– only in P+–FSI– (purple) and Na+–FSI– (green) states. The percent - age of FSI– in both single coordination states in Na12 is very low, resulting in the highest co-coordinated FSI– of 97%, exceeding the 92% co-coordination percentage in 1:1.5 PolyIL/LiFSI. Therefore, the 1:2 ratio could be an optimal ratio for Na salt. For the Na14 case, with the added salt doubled, the percentage of FSI – in the Na+– FSI– coordination state increases markedly to 19.7%, indicating the growth of the Na+–FSI–-rich domains, and this change is consistent with the LiFSI study26. The 1:2 cation ratio was then examined for both K and Mg sys - tems. As shown in Fig. 1c and the snapshots in Supplementary Fig. 1, the percentage of FSI– in the FSI––Me+ coordination state is 8% and 23.1% for K12 and Mg12, respectively, suggesting the existence of the excessive K and Mg salts; lower salt concentrations should be examined next to increase the co-coordination state. As expected, at",564
test_pdfs/004.pdf,2,3," a 1:1 ratio, the co-coordination state in K11 and Mg11 increases from 91% and 73.9% to 94% and 85.4%, respectively. The cation ratios to give the maximum co-coordination anion state are 1:1.5, 1:2 and 1:1 for Li +, Na+ and K+, respectively. Interestingly, this order does not follow the order of the three alkali elements in the periodic table, but may be related to the different cation–anion coordination abilities. For example, when comparing the coordination numbers (CNs; Supplementary Table 1) between Na12 and K12, the CN of P +–FSI– is near 9 in Na12, which is greater than the 8.1 in K12. An opposite situation occurs for the CN of Me+– FSI–, which is greater in K12 (6.4) than in Na12 (5.6). Therefore, the co-coordinated K+ concentration around the polycationic backbone bridged by FSI– should be less than the Na+ concentration. The CN also helps us to understand the extensive Mg–FSI-enriched domains in the Mg12 system, which are explained in Supplementary Note 1, with the detailed coordination analysis of the RDF results. the impact of the chemical environment on ion diffusion The diffusion of ions is investigated through the mean square displacement (Supplementary Fig. 3) to evaluate the ionic con - ductivity in sodium, potassium and magnesium electrolytes. K12, Na12 and Mg11 that have the same anion concentration are selected and compared. In general, ion diffusion in the alkali metal ion systems is one to two orders of magnitude higher than that in the magnesium system. At 353 K, the diffusion of metal ions and anions in the K12 system is faster than that in the Na12 system. Similar results were also reported in an ionic liquid elec - trolyte, N-methyl-N-propylpyrrolidinium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (C3mpyrFSI)38,39; when mixed with the same amount of KFSI or NaFSI salt, the ionic liquid system with the KFSI salt has higher ionic conductivity. This may be due to the lower Lewis acidity of potassium, making its interaction with anions weaker than that of sodium, which is confirmed by the density functional theory cal - culation of the binding energy (Eb) between metal ions and anions. Figure 2a plots the Eb and t",544
test_pdfs/004.pdf,2,4,"he diffusivity (D) of the metal ions and FSI–. The methods of calculating Eb and D are described in Supplementary Note 2. For comparison, the diffusivity of Li + from the previously simulated 1:1.5 LiFSI system26 was also calculated. The diffusion of metal ions and anions follows KFSI > NaFSI > LiFSI > MgFSI, which is in contrast with the order of E b. Interestingly, the plotted Eb versus log(D) profile of alkali metal cations at a given temperature of 353 K shows a near-linear relation - ship, that is log(D) = AEb + B (A and B are constants). If we consider that diffusion processes follow an Arrhenius or Vogel–Tammann–Fulcher relationship such that the logarithm of diffusion and the activation energy E a at a given temperature T also follow the same type of equation, this leads to the inference of a positive correlation between the binding energy of Me+–FSI– and the activation energy of Me+ diffusion, at this given temperature and salt concentration. All alkali metal ions are more diffusive than anions, which con - trasts with traditional PEO-based PEs. Considering that the poly - cations are immobilized, higher alkali cation transference numbers can be obtained. The opposite result is observed for the Mg 2+ sys- tem; in addition to having the lowest ion diffusivities, Mg2+ is also less diffusive than FSI–. Next, we compared ions having distinct fast and slow diffusion (defined according to their mean square displacement values in Supplementary Fig. 4) in both Na12 and Mg11 and studied how the coordination environment affects the fast ion diffusion. Figure 2c,d calculates the RDFs of fast versus fast, fast versus slow and slow ver - sus slow FSI– and Na+, first considering the correlation between their diffusion. Both fast (or both slow) FSI– and Na+ tend to coordinate with each other, according to their more prominent RDF peaks and higher CN values, compared to those of the fast and slow coordi - nation. This could suggest that the movement of Na+ and FSI– has a strong correlation. Then, Fig. 2e,f investigates the coordination NAture MA teriAls | VOL 21 | OCTOBER 2022 | 1175–1182 | www.nature.com/naturematerials 1",511

Both show that fast species coordinate less with polycations, while slow species tend to coordinate more with polycations. Finally, Fig. 2g,h investigates the number of Na+ and FSI– ions surrounding the selected fast and slow Na+. Interestingly, there are always more Na+ and FSI– ions sur - rounding the fast Na+; that is, the environment rich in Na+ and FSI– favours fast metal cation dynamics, as demonstrated by a snapshot in Fig. 2b. The fast Na+ (red) has the molten Na–FSI salt-like chemical environment, which is commonly seen in superconcentrated ionic liquid electrolytes 31,35,40. By contrast, the environment of the slow Na+ (blue) contains fewer FSI– and Na+ within the same distance range. This suggests that the molten salt regions formed in this PolyIL can promote metal ion diffusion at 353 K, thus providing a possible theoretical guideline for future PE design, that is, by enhancing the molten salt-like domains in a PolyIL matrix. We will show some experimental evidence to validate this idea in the next section. In th",261
test_pdfs/004.pdf,3,2,"e case of the Mg11 system (Supplementary Fig. 5a,b), we observe some contrasting behaviour. The fast FSI – preferentially coordinates with the polycationic backbone. The environment of the fast Mg 2+ is also found near the polycation rather than the domain rich in Mg2+ and FSI− (Supplementary Fig 5d–f). This opposite situation can be understood by considering the binding strength between the metal ions and FSI – (Fig. 2b). The interaction of Mg2+ with FSI− is too strong to enhance the diffusion of both. Therefore, the ionic conductivity enhancement in PolyIL-IS requires the metal ion–anion interaction to be weak enough to allow fast exchange in the coordination environment, which we discuss in more detail below. For the development of PolyIL capable of conducting multi - valent ions (for example, Mg2+, Zn2+ and so on), one key is to reduce the metal ion–anion binding strength to a similar magnitude as that of the alkali metal ion–anion. Metal ion diffusion mechanisms In this section, we show that the alkali metal ions in the PolyIL-IS system diffuse mainly through a structural diffusion mechanism,",253
test_pdfs/004.pdf,3,3," as opposed to the vehicular diffusion mechanism suggested for the low salt concentration PolyIL 30. Briefly speaking, ‘vehicular diffusion’ refers to the transport of metal ions together with their ligands, and ‘hopping’ refers to complete and direct ligand exchange, whereas ‘structural diffusion’ refers to the transport of metal ions through the partial exchange of ligands. However, the diffusion mechanism of metal ions here is also distinguished from ‘the directly coupled ionic mobility’ in traditional PEs, such as PEO, where the ligands (that is, polar groups in the backbone) are also partly exchanged during the metal ion diffusion process (Supplementary Fig. 6a). The metal ions in PolyIL can not coordinate directly with the cationic polymer backbones; instead, bridging coordination through anions occurs. Therefore, metal cations still diffuse through anion exchange.

At low salt concentrations, all anions coordi - nate with polycations and polymer segmental movement can affect anion movement and thus affects the motion of the co-coordinated metal ions (Fig. 1a) 30. However, at high salt concentrations, such as Na14 and K12 (Fig. 1c), anions either weakly co-coordinate with polycations (binding energy calculation in Supplementary Fig. 6b) or coordinate only with metal ions in a molten salt region; the metal ion diffusion may become more decoupled from polymer segmen - tal motion in this case. Therefore, the diffusion mechanism of metal ions in PolyIL-IS is very similar to that in the salt-concentrated ionic liquids where there are metal ion–anion aggregates, and a structural diffusion mechanism takes place. The structural diffusion mechanism can be studied by tracing the coordinated anions (or ligands) of a given metal cation during its diffusion. If w",208

We define ‘a cage-restructure period’ (Fig. 3a) as the period between the formation of an initial cage A and the formation of a new cage B. In terms of ‘vehicular mechanism’ , this period will be sufficiently long so that the metal ions mainly diffuse with the cage. By contrast, this period for a ‘structural mechanism’ should be much shorter, with the result that the diffusion of ions occurs through the cage restructuring. For the ‘hopping mechanism’ , the anion exchange occurs instantaneously and causes ion migration via a hop from one cage to another. In Fig. 3b , the metal ion cage restructuring is analysed for Na12 and K12 through a self-defined cage-restructure correlation func - tion C(t) based on a cage-state function h(t) illustrated in Fig. 3a (the definition of C(t) is des",211

It takes 3.5 ns to decrease to 0.01 in K12, which is much faster than in Na12, which requires the 12.7 ns. Figure 3c,e analyses the distance the Na or K travels during a cage-restructure period.

For PolyIL systems, Tg decreases with increasing salt concentration; for example, Na11 > Na12 > Na14 (Fig. 4a and Supplementary Fig. 7b–d).

The conductivity was measured for Na11, Na12, K11 and K12 in Fig. 4b . Na12 has the highest overall conductivity ranging from 10−5 to over 10−3 S cm−1 between 30 and 100 °C. Notably, these values are comparable to that of LiTFSI(PEO)20 (ref. 41) and NaTFSI(PEO)9 (ref. 8), which are between 4.5 × 10−6 and 3 × 10−4 S cm−1 from 20 to 70 °C. Na12 has higher conductivity than Na11, which is consistent with the MD prediction and corresponds to its lower Tg. The conductivities of the K systems are greatly affected by the heat treatment history. They have overall lower conductivities during the first heating cycle than the Na systems. K11 also has higher conductivities than K12, which does not correspond to its lower T g.

Note that only the amorphous phase was obtained within the MD simulation time limit, and this also suggests that maintaining a single, amorphous polymer phase is essential to ensure high ionic conductivity in these superconcentrated systems.

Interestingly, neither does it completely correlate with the Tg, as observed in Fig. 4a,b, where the sodium systems have the overall highest Tg and conductivities. Li12, on the other hand, has the lowest Tg and an ionic conductivity around 0.7 × 10−4 S cm−1 at 80 °C, which is lower than that of Na12 (1.02 × 10−3 S cm−1) or K12 (1.2 × 10−3 S cm−1 at second heating).

The log (Rτ) is as high as around 6.3, suggesting a very weak coupling between the mobile ions and the polymer matrix, as this value is close to zero for a fully coupled system 43,44.

For solvent-free PEs, the current density applied in this case is much higher than that of state-of-the-art electrolyte systems, such as the 0.1 mA cm−2 that is used for PEO– NaFSI (ref. 46). More surprisingly, the polarization voltage for the Na12 electrolyte is relatively low, around 100 mV (inset in Fig. 4d), even at such a high current density. We ascribe this superior and stable plating/stripping performance to high ionic conductivity and a high Na+ transference number of Na12. A good oxidation stabil - ity around 4.4 V was shown by linear sweep voltammetry, suggest - ing the possibility of Na12 to be paired with commercial cathode materials such as NaFePO 4 or Na3V2(PO4)3, which requires further experimental verification (Supplementary Fig. 9 and limitations of the method was discussed in the Electrochemical stability window (ESW) section in Supplementary Note 3). A good mechanical prop - erty was also demonstrated for the Na12 composite (Supplementary Fig. 11 and Supplementary Table 6). The extra tests on Na14, which has more molten salt domains, also show promising results, including a higher steady-state Na+ current at 0.064 mA (initial current, 0.084 mA); a higher Na transference number of 0.63 at 80 °C; and the potential of cycling at high current densities (Supplementary Fig. 10). However, the molten salt regime is metastable and transforms through crystallization after a few days, and thus future work will focus on stabilizing such systems. Some strategies proposed in previous studies on polymer-in-salt systems can be considered as future directions, including the use of mixed salts 47,48 or of the low-melting-temperature, weak-coordination salts28 that we and others are currently studying. In summary, we demonstrate that PolyIL-IS systems have the ver - satility for the design of solid PEs for multiple battery chemistries, including Li, Na and K, and can achieve high metal ion transport and transference number. The optimal compositions can be stud ",514

Specifically, a structural diffusion mechanism is proposed for metal ions in the PolyIL-IS system, and rapid restructuring of the metal ion coordination cage is critical to achieving high metal ion diffusivity. The evolution of a molten salt-like region within the PolyIL facilitates rapid metal ion diffusion, provided that the binding energy of the salt is not excessive. Finally, the computa - tional predictions are verified experimentally, and the Na12 system achieves an excellent performance, thus demonstrating the broad potential of this polymer system for the development of future all-solid-state high-energy-density batteries. This work also opens up a cost-effective computational approach to the composition design of PolyILs.

The PDADMA FSI consists of 12 PDADMA chains with each having 12 repeat cationic units and 144 FSI anions. The amount of the salt (NaFSI, KFSI or (MgFSI)2) is decided according to different polycation/metal ion ratios of 1:1, 1:2 or 1:4 (given in Supplementary Table 3). All polymers and ions are randomly placed in a cubic box using Packmol50. The initial structures are equilibrated at 600 K and then cooled to 393 K and then 353 K. At each temperature, the system is equilibrated for 2 ns in an isothermal-isobaric NPT ensemble using a Berendsen thermostat and barostat with a relaxation constant of 1.0 ps each. The system is equilibrated again for 1 ns at 353 K using a Nóse–Hoover thermostat and a Hoover barostat with relaxation constants of 0.5 and 5.0 ps, respectively, and another 1 ns production run follows, for structure analysis. The velocity Verlet algorithm is adopted for integration. The time step is 1 fs and the pressure is 1 atm. The cut-offs for van der Waals force and the real space of Ewald are 12 Å. The Ewald summation method with a precision of 1 × 10 −6 is used to treat the Coulomb interaction in a periodic system. All C–H bonds are constrained.

The OPLS_AA force field is used for MD simulation. The force field parameters of the FSI – and sodium ion are taken from the CL&P force field (2018 version)51.

Among the various solid-state electrolytes, polymer electrolytes (PEs) are considered to be particularly promising owing to their high flexibility, excellent processability, light- weight, and low cost.

In this work, we successfully develop an in situ polymerized 1,3-dioxane PE with superior oxidation stability and elevated Li-metal compatibility, which enables the stable operation of LMBs with various state-of-the-art high-voltage cathodes (4.5 V).

Results and discussion Design rationale and fabrication of P-DOX PEs As shown in Fig. 1, compared to ex situ polymerized PEs, the in situ polymerization can greatly improve interfacial contact between PEs and electrodes since the liquid electrolyte precur- sor is able to fully wet the electrode layers, providing connec-tion pathways for fast ion transport. Although in situ polymerization of the DOL monomer has made significantprogress in improving interfacial contact and cycling life oflow-voltage Li||LFP cells, high-voltage tolerance and interfacialstability are still challenging. 23,30–32To be specific, the poor oxidative stability of the DOL solvent has prevented the result- ing P-DOL PEs from being applied as high-voltage cathodes, and their compatibility with Li-metal remains to be improved. Aiming to",245
test_pdfs/005.pdf,3,2," fabricate a novel PE in situ with excellent high- voltage tolerance and interfacial compatibility, the conven-tional five-membered DOL was replaced with a six-memberedring ether, namely DOX, owing to the following several merits:(1) the P-DOX with a longer alkyl chain has a lower HOMOenergy level, which is expected to exhibit a higher oxidation stability; (2) the longer alkyl chain would also weaken the solvating ability of the P-DOX, which may not only bestow ahigher Li +transference number, but also lead to an inorganic- rich SEI that is more conductive and robust.A typical cationic initiator of Al(OTf) 3was selected to initiate the ring-opening polymerization of DOX. As shown in Fig. 2a, with the addition of an optimized Al(OTf) 3amount of 20 mmol (Fig. S1, ESI †), the liquid electrolyte of LiFSI–DOX (molar ratio of 1 : 8) quickly polymerized without liquidity. The change of ionic conductivity versus time was carefully investigated to evaluate the polymerization reaction and ion transport proper-ties of the PEs. As shown in Fig. 2b, the conductivity o",270

Thecorresponding electrochemical impedance spectra with theincreasing polymerization time are collected in Fig. S2a (ESI †). Without Al(OTf) 3, the ionic conductivity of the LiFSI–DOX solution does not show obvious change (Fig. 2b and Fig. S2b,ESI†). For comparison purpose, the P-DOL PE was also fabri- cated via in situ polymerization of LiFSI–DOL solution with same salt-to-solvent molar ratio ( i.e., 1 : 8) under the same polymerization conditions for 12 h (Fig. S3, ESI †). The chemical structure evolution before and after polymer- ization was first characterized by Fourier transform infraredspectroscopy (FTIR). As shown in Fig. 2c, the peaks of DOX ringC–O–C bond vibration almost disappear while a new peakcorresponding to the long-chain C–O–C bond vibration appearsafter the polymerization reaction, indicating that the DOXmonomer undergoes ring-opening polymerization reac",297

To better reflect the actual situation inside the cell, NMR and GPC characterization studies were also performed with the in situ polymerized P-DOX and P-DOL in cells, which showed similar results (Fig. S5 and S6,ESI†). The thermal stability and crystallinity of a polymer have a significant impact on its application as SSEs. Diﬀerential scan-ning calorimetry (DSC) was conducted to study the thermaltransitions of these electrolytes. As shown in Fig. 2e and Fig. S7(ESI† ), typical crystallization ( T c) and melting ( Tm) phase transi- tion peaks are observed for L-DOL and L-DOX electrolytes.However, no crystallization peak is observed for P-DOL andP-DOX PEs, indicating that they are essentially amorphous.According to the Li +conduction mechanism in polymers, the absence of a crystallization region in the in situ formed PEs would be beneficial for the fast migration of Li+, leading to high ionic conductivity.33In addition, the thermogravimetric analy- ",351

Furthermore, the flammability tests indicate that the polymer-ized electrolytes have much better flame retardancy than liquidelectrolytes, among which the P-DOX PE did not catch fire at all (Fig. S9, ESI †). As shown in Fig. 2f, even though the P-DOX PE exhibits a slightly lower ionic conductivity than that of P-DOL PE at the measured temperature range from 30 to 70 1C, it delivers a much lower activation energy (0.20 eV) compared toP-DOL PEs (0.51 eV) according to the Arrhenius equation, whichcan be attributed to the low binding energy of the P-DOX chainwith Li +(Fig. S10, ESI †), showcasing that the P-DOX PE has a low Li+migration barrier. Furthermore, it is found that the7Li-NMR peak of P-DOX PE was down shifted compared to that of P-DOLPE, owing to the enhanced shielding eﬀect from the nearestneighbors of Li +, which indicates that P-DOX has a weaker solvating ability than P-DOL (Fig. S11a, ESI †).34Moreover, as shown in Fig. S11b (ESI †), the Raman spectra show that the coordination state of the FSI/C0a n i o ni nP - D O Xs h i f t e dt oah i g h e r wavenumber compared to that in P-DOL, suggesting that the Li+–FSI/C0association was intensified in P-DOX that leads to the formation of aggreg",384

Densityfunctional theory (DFT) calculations were first conducted toverify the oxidation stability of the P-DOL and P-DOX polymers.As shown in Fig. 3a and Fig. S13 (ESI† ), no matter how many repeating units calculated, the P-DOX always exhibits a lowerHOMO energy level than that of P-DOL at the same chain length, suggesting an excellent oxidation stability of P-DOX. The intrinsic oxidative stability of the L-DOX, P-DOL and P-DOXelectrolytes was then tested by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV)with a stainless steel (SS) as the working electrode. As shown inFig. 3b, the oxidative decomposition of the L-DOX electrolyteoccurs at around 3.5 V defined at 0.05 mA cm /C02, whereas the oxidation potential of P-DOX PE is significantly increased to4.7 V after in situ ring opening polymerizatio",359

The oxidationstability is also much better than that of the widely investigatedP-DOL PEs ( i.e., 4.1 V), indicating that the oxidation stability of the PEs can be eﬀectively improved through tuning the mole-cular structure of the monomer precursor. Changing the work-ing electrode to Al foil (a common current collector for thecathode) also exhibits a similar phenomenon, that is, theP-DOX PE possesses a much higher oxidation potential than that of L-DOX and P-DOL electrolytes (Fig. S14, ESI †). To further characterize the practical oxidation stability of P-DOX PE in batteries, the electrochemical floating experiment was carried out on a LiNi 0.33Co0.33Mn 0.33O2(NCM111) electrode,19 where the measured leakage current provides a direct standardfor evaluating the oxidation stability of electrolytes.

A leakage current of 22 mA is detected for P-DOL PE at 4.0 V, and the leakage current sharply increases to that exceeding 200 mA at 4.6 V, suggesting that the P-DOL PE is unstable under high-voltage.

The compatibility of PEs with Li-metal anode is another key factor aﬀecting the performance of high-energy density LMBs.The reversibility of Li deposition and stripping processes inL-DOX, P-DOL, and P-DOX electrolytes was first investigatedin Li||Li symmetric cells. For the testing at 1 mA cm /C02with 1m Ahc m/C02(Fig. 4a), all three electrolytes exhibit smooth andlow overpotential during the initial 200 h.

Meanwhile, theoverpotential was gradually increased for the P-DOL PE due tothe accumulation of thick SEI and dead Li, and the cell iseventually subjected to a sudden short-circuit at about 440 h.Remarkably, using P-DOX PE, the cell demonstrates extremelystable cycling with negligible increase in the overpotential for over 1300 h. In addition, the interfacial resistance of the Li||Li symmetric cell using P-DOX PE remains very low andstable during cycling, while that using P-DOL PE or L-DOXliquid electrolyte gradually increases (Fig. S15, ESI †).

When the current density was increased to 2.5 mA cm /C02and 3m Ac m/C02(Fig. 4b and Fig. S16, ESI †), the Li||Li cell using either L-DOX electrolyte or P-DOL PE is not able to cyclenormally and the cell fails within a few cycles, while that usingP-DOX PE can sustain stable cycling for hundreds of cycles. Critical current density (CCD) is an important parameter for evaluating the tolerance of batteries under high power density,which was investigated by testing Li||Li symmetric cell atprogressively diﬀerent current densities. 37As shown in Fig. S17 (ESI† ), when the current density increases to 5.5 mA cm/C02, the P-DOL PE cannot maintain a stable polarization profile withsome sharp peaks appears, accompanied by a decrease in thepolarization voltage caused by micro short-circuit, suggesting that the P-DOL PE has reached the ",312

In contrast, the P-DOX PE can still retain a relatively stablevoltage polarization up to 8.0 mA cm /C02, indicating that P-DOX PE possesses better capability for withstanding high currentdensity than P-DOL PE in the LMBs. Li deposition morphology and interfacial chemistry The morphology of the Li-metal electrode in a Li||Li cell after 200 cycles was characterized by using a scanning electron microscope (SEM). As shown in Fig. S18 (ESI †), the Li-metal electrode in a liquid L-DOX electrolyte exhibits a porous andheterogeneous morphology, which increases the interfacialresistance and leads to rapid cell failure during repeatedplating/stripping processes. For the Li-metal in P-DOL PE,massive porous Li deposits disappears while the surface is stillrough, owing to the fact that PE could eﬀectively reduce the reactivity with Li-metal. In contrast, the Li-metal in P-DOX PE presents a smooth and flat surface, indicating that a highlyuniform and dense Li deposition was achieved in this PE.To intuitively observe the Li deposition behavior, the mor- phology of Li electrodeposits at a plating current density of 1.0 mA cm /C02was also observed by in operando optical micr",280

For a Li||Li symmetric cell with P-DOL PE, a large number of mossy and needle-like Li dendrites were observed after 30 minof deposition and continued to grow during the followingplating process (Fig. 4c), indicating the insuﬃcient Li compat-ibility of P-DOL PE. In sharp contrast, the Li-metal with P-DOXPE delivered a dendrite-free and smooth growth throughout the60 min of deposition process (Fig. 4d), confirming that the rationally selected DOX monomer could bestow the resulting in situ polymerized PE with uniform Li deposition morphology and highly reversible Li plating/stripping behavior. Interfacial chemistry is critical for achieving uniform Li deposition morphology, which was investigated by performingX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis using an Ar + sputtering technique on the Li-metal electrode after plating/stripping for 200 cycles. As shown in Fig. 5, massive organic species (mainly lithium alkoxy) were observed on the surface of Li-metal electrode in P-DOL PE, which were mainly derivedfrom DOL or P-DOL that is considered to be unstable andresistive. Meanwhile, some inorganic species (mainly LiF andoxysulfides) were derived from the LiFSI, while their intens",279

In con- trast, for the Li-metal electrode in P-DOX PE, the surface isenriched with inorganic species ( i.e., LiF and oxysulfides), and a small amount of organic species. As Ar +sputtering proceeds, the inorganic species are gradually further boosted, and theirintensities remain quite strong even after 150 s of sputtering,suggesting that P-DOX PE has induced the formation of moreanion-derived inorganic-rich SEI compared to that of P-DOL PE,which was ascribed to the weaker Li +binding energy with P-DOX than P-DOL according to the DFT calculation, andNMR and Raman characterization studies (Fig. S10 and S11, ESI†).

The electrochemical perfor- mance of Li||NCM111 cells was first investigated with a cutoﬀvoltage of 2.8–4.3 V. As shown in Fig. 6a, for the cell usingL-DOX electrolyte or P-DOL PE, the specific capacity decreasesrapidly with highly fluctuating CE, which is due to the pooroxidation tolerance of the L-DOX electrolyte and P-DOL PE aswell as the formation of dendritic and dead Li at the anodeside.

Besides, their interfacial resistanceremains stable during cycling (Fig. S19b, ESI †), suggesting excellent interfacial compatibility towards both high voltagecathodes and Li-metal anodes while severe increase in voltagepolarization and interfacial resistance can be observed for thecell using P-DOL PE (Fig. S19 and S20, ESI †). The morphology of the NCM111 cathode after 500 cycles was characterized by SEM. As shown in Fig. 6c and Fig. S21 (ESI †), severe particle cracking and even pulverization is found for theNCM111 cathode after cycling in the L-DOX electrolyte or P- DOL PE, which is due to the severe oxidation of the L-DOX electrolyte and P-DOL PE on the surface of the cathode, causingstructural degradation of the cathode. In contrast, the NCM111cathode after cycling in P-DOX PE maintains a spherical andintact microstructure with negligible change compared to thepristine NCM111 cathode before cycling (Fig. S21, ESI †).

In addition, according to the XPS results (Fig. S23,ESI†), much fewer decomposition byproducts were detected on NCM111 cathode after cycling in P-DOX PE compared to that cycling in P-DOL PE, which was attributed to the superior oxida- tion stability of the P-DOX that inhibits the continuously parasiticreaction between the cathode and the PE. Furthermore, as shownin Fig. 6d and Fig. S24 (ESI †), the Li||NCM111 cell using P-DOX PE also exhibits excellent rate ca pability from 0.1C to 5C, with a specific capacity of 158.2 mA h g /C01at 0.1C and can maintain a high capacity of 110.1 mA h g/C01at 5.0C, which is suﬃcient for its practical application at room temperature. As the energy density is proportional to the capacity and discharge voltage of the cell, elevating the upper cutoﬀ voltageof the cell would greatly boost its energy density. Therefore, thesuperiority of this in situ formed P-DOX PE was further inves- tigated under higher cutoﬀ voltages. As shown in Fig. S25(ESI† ), under a cutoﬀ voltage of 4.4 V, the Li||NCM11",338

The flammability of the electrolytes was tests by burning an electrolyte-infiltrated glass fiber separator. The GPC and NMR characterization studies were conducted with both in situ and ex situ generated PEs to better reflect the actual situation in the cells. Since a large amount of testing sample is required, the other characterization studies wereperformed with the ex situ generated PEs.

The separator was used toprovide separation and control the thickness of the in situ polymerized PEs, which can avoid short circuits in the liquidstate. The amount of the liquid electrolyte employed was 80 mLfor each cell during cell assembly. The cells were placed in anoven at 60 1C for 36 h before testing to complete the polymeri- zation.

However, known polymer electrolytes have much lower ionic conductivity than liquid/ceramics at room temperature, which limits their practical use in batteries. Here we show that precise positioning of designed repeating units in alternating polymer sequences lays the foundation for homogenized Li + distribution, non-aggregated Li+-anion solvation and sequence-assisted site-to-site ion migration, facilitating the tuning of Li+ conductivity by up to three orders of magnitude. The assembled all-solid-state batteries facilitate reversible and dendrite-mitigated cycling against Li metal from ambient to elevated temperatures.

Increasing the energy and lifespan of lithium-ion batteries is criti - cal in enabling intensive electrification and decarbonization in the transportation and power sectors1. While replacing the graphite anode with Li metal can double energy density at the system level (>500 Wh kg−1)2,3, innovations in electrolyte usage are needed to address challenges in regard to the poor efficiency of lithium metal and to seed future technology advances4. Liquid electrolytes are known for issues relating to their uncontrollable Li–electrolyte par- asitic reactions and dendrites, which hinder the implementation of Li metal batteries following decades of development5. Although ceramic electrolytes provide high conductivity at room temperature, they are fragile and suffer from poor interfacial/dimensional stabil- ity6–8. We focus on solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs), which possess excellent processability and tunable interfacial compatibility9,10, offering opportunities to enable all-solid-state batteries (ASSBs). Unfortunately, a long-standing challenge in regard to SPEs is their poor ion conductivity,",222
test_pdfs/006.pdf,1,3," which prohibits the ambient-temperature use of polymers11,12. To date, lithium metal-based ASSB operation with SPEs has been shown only with (1) a triblock copolymer electrolyte at 60 °C (ref. 13) and (2) a perfluoropolyether-based electrolyte at 80 °C without solvent residues14.Ion conduction in polymer electrolytes free of solvents15 hinges on the segmental motion of polymers, where ions hop statistically among polymer coordinating sites6,16. Therefore, ionic conductivity (σ) is governed by the concentration of dissociated ions (ci) and mobil - ity of polymer chains (μi)6,9. Many studies have focused on increasing segmental chain motion via reduction in glass transition temperature (Tg) using plasticizing additives17, changing the types of monomer18 and tailoring macromolecular architectures19. Because both Li+ cations and counter-anions are mobile in conventional polymer electrolytes (for example, polyethylene oxide (PEO)), low transference number (tLi+) of 0.2–0.4 and low Li+ conductivity (σLi+, σLi+ = σ × tLi+) can lead to severe transport-related polarization20,21.

Distinct from conventional polymer electrolytes, Li cations in single-ion polymer electrolytes (SIPEs) move along the polymeric back - bone with immobilized polyanions (Fig. 1 ), which yields tLi+ close to 1 (ref. 23). Owing to the regulated anions and increased σLi+ (refs. 20,21,24), it is predicted that SIPEs could reduce ionic con - ductivity requirement by a factor of ten25.

Following kinetic investigations (Supplementary Table 1), the reactivity ratios of both Li-salt (rA) and PEO-substituted (rB) vinyl compounds were found to be close to zero because kAA << kAB and kBB << kBA (Supplementary Fig. 1), suggesting a strong cross-propagation tendency to yield alternating sequences. To probe the effect of sequence regulation, we synthesized SIPEs of homo-, block- and random sequences for parallel comparison (Fig. 3a and Supplementary Table 2). Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation shows that sequencing of fluorinated Li-salt monomer and PEO-substituted vinyl ether promotes ion dissociation, with alter-SIPE exhibiting maximally homogeneous Li+ distribution among all sequences examined (Fig. 3b and Supplemen - tary Fig. 3). According to Manning counterion condensation theory, ion dissociation in SIPE would be enhanced with increased spacing distance (L ) between adjacent anionic units on the polymer backbone (Supplementary equation (5)), where reduced density of Li+ and anions on the alternating backbone (Supplementary Table 4) is expected to provide a greater degree of Li+ dissociation than homo-SIPE36. While alter-, random- and block-SIPEs exhibit similar Li+ densities, the lower coefficients of s.d. from the average Li+ density in alter-SIPE (±19.1 ver- sus ±26.7 and ±33.7%; Fig. 3c ) indicate greater Li+ homogeneity and minimization of localized Li+ ions. Uniform Li+ distribution can facilitate dissociation and reduce cationic aggregates16. However, homo-SIPE exhibits a higher Li+ density than SIPEs with other sequences, ascribed to the absence of PEO-based spacers that result in higher averaged ion ",439
test_pdfs/006.pdf,2,2,"density. The microscopic distribution of Li+ was evaluated quantitively by simulation of the probable r distance between two Li+ ions using radial distribution function (RDF). In Fig. 3d, alter-SIPE displays a single peak situated at about 2.5 Å of the distance between adjacent Li+–Li+ centres, while additional peaks ranging from 4 to 9 Å (grey circles) were observed for random-, block- and homo-SIPEs. Combined with the lowest Li–Li coordination number in alter-SIPE (Supplementary Fig. 4), Li distribu- tion in alter-SIPE could be more homogeneous and less aggregated than that in other SIPEs. These MD results are supported by Raman and 7Li solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopies. Because the Raman S–N bending peak in Li-salt monomers is sensitive to cation–anion complexation37,38, the maximal ratio of contact ion pair (CIP, 758 cm−1) and aggregated ion cluster (AGG) in alter-SIPE (Supple- mentary Table 9) indicates reduced formation of aggregations via ionic interactions39. On the other hand, the other three SIPEs show gradually more dominant presence of AGGs upshifted to 764 cm−1 (Fig. 3e). In NMR spectra, lithium nuclei in alter- SIPE were most shielded, with a negative shift (–0.58 ppm) among different sequences (Fig. 3f ) because of enhanced coordination with adjacent ethers, consistent with the maximal percentage of Li-O (O atoms in C-O-C) coordination interaction as revealed by MD (Supplementary Figs. 7 and 8), illustrating a uniform Li+ distribution environment and modulated Li+ solvation structure. In contrast, lithium nuclei in random-, block- and homo-SIPEs were less shielded, with chemical shifts gradually changing to –0.17 ppm, suggesting impeded Li+ dissociation from anionic centres. Enhanced Li+ dissociation in alter-SIPE is supported by the bind- ing strength of ion ",447

When ionic charge distribution in SIPEs forms polyanion–cation clusters that could aggravate strong ion–ion interactions between Li+ and anionic counterparts, severely retarding Li+ dissociation9,16. The adoption of highly delocalized anionic groups such as sulfonylimides13,26,27 can increase dissociation compared with carbonate and sulfonate anions23. Unfortunately, state-of-the-art SIPEs achieved σ and σLi+ only in the range 10−9–10−6 S cm−1 (ref. 16), which is lower than that of conventional polymer electrolytes, necessitating leverage of new structural motifs to promote Li+ dissociation. Inspired by natural macromolecules that can achieve complex regulation and recognition by delicate control of not only side-chain functionalities but also sequential arrangement of monomers 28,29, we envision that manipulation of polymer sequence could strengthen the control of ion transport30 by precise ‘encoding’ of delocalized anionic groups and regulation of ion distribution at the molecular level, pro - moting Li+ dissociation in SIPEs. Herein, we report the development of a solid-state fluorinated SIPE with alternating sequence (alter-SIPE) that is composed of periodically arranged anionic and PEO pendants, creating homogeneous Li+ distributions, non-aggregated Li+-anion solvation and enhanced Li+-anion dissociation in the SPE matrix. This microstructure leads to a concerted PEO-Li+-anion migration, ena - bling σLi+ of ~4.0 × 10−5 S cm−1 at 30 °C (tLi+ = 0.93), which is tuned up by between one and three orders of magnitude and is compara - ble to that of liquid-state PEO31. Such sequencing has lowered the operating temperature of ASSBs with dry polymer electrolytes, from 60–80 °C (refs. 13 ,32) to ",426

The fundamental importance of polymer sequence provides a new paradigm to manipulate Li+ conduction, and informs a promising molecular strategy to access non-flammable, processable and high-performance ASSBs. Promotion of Li+ dissociation by sequencing The synthesis of alter-SIPEs uses a fluorinated Li-salt monomer and PEO-substituted vinyl ethers as electronic acceptor (A) and donor (D), respectively, to ensure the cross-propagation of two monomers along the main chain in a radical reaction mechanism (Fig. 2)33. Meanwhile, number-average molecular weight (Mn) and molecular weight distribu - tion (Ɖ) are known to change the fundamental properties of polymers34. We therefore developed a photo-controlled radical alternating copoly - merization (photo-CRAP)35 to yield target polymers of predefined chain length.

This trend is consistent with that of the average residence time (τ ) for Li+ and anions, from 116.5 to 137.3 ps by MD, where alter- SIPE provides the shortest τ (Fig. 3h) owing to the fastest dissociation kinetics of Li+ (ref. 39 ). These simulation and experimental results demonstrate the effective role of regulating the polymer sequence in promotion of Li+-anion dissociation.

Kinetic studies verified controlled chain growth and equal consump - tion of comonomers in five reactions, indicating an alternating sequence (Supplementary Fig. 12). The Li-salt monomers of both P1 and P3 led to considerably higher dissociation constants (Kd) in solu- tion (Kd = 0.048, 0.052 mol l−1) and in the polymer matrix at varying concentration (Fig. 4b and Supplementary Figs. 13 and 14)42, which are higher than those in P2 , P4 and P5 with non-fluorinated groups, suggesting that trifluoromethyl substituents promote dissociation owing to their electron-withdrawal effect. Meanwhile, P1 and P2 with alkyl substituents have lower Tg (2 and 8 °C, respectively; Fig. 4c and Supplementary Fig. 15) than P3–P5 with aromatic groups, supporting the premise that higher chain mobility is realized by structural modula- tion. Among five",305

We synthesized P11 and P12 with the same repeating units as P8 but different Mn,NMR (9.0 and 27.8 kDa; Supplementary Fig. 18) to probe the influence of molecular weight. As analysed by rheological studies (Fig. 4g), P8 and P12 retained higher storage moduli (G’ ) than loss moduli (G’’ ), evidencing a viscoelastic solid feature where P11 pro - vides G’ < G’’ at low frequencies, suggesting a viscoelastic liquid state. Although the stronger mechanical strength of P8 and P12 compared with that of P11 could be favourable for lithium dendrite suppression43, P12 yielded reduced σ (1.2 × 10−5 S cm−1; Supplementary Table 8) relative to P8 due to constrained chain mobility. Chain mobility was not restricted by the crystallization of PEO pendants in P8. When small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) was con - ducted with P8, no di",337

The amorphous property shows good agreement with the absence of Tm in P8 (Fig. 4i), where PEO-1 of an analogous molecular weight (20.0 kDa) to P8 exhibits peaks of crystallization and melting (Tc = 44 °C, Tm = 65 °C). The amorphous microstructure of alter-SIPE is beneficial for chain movement, and could avoid abrupt reduction in ion transport caused by crystallization.Sequence-assisted ion transport and Li+ conduction Alter- SIPE P8 attained the highest ionic conductivity of 4.2 × 10−5 S cm−1 at 30 °C and 1.7 × 10−4 S cm−1 at 70 °C, which is outstanding for SPEs provided with the largely immobilized anionic moieties. The ionic conductivity of P8 was between one and three orders of magnitude higher than random- and block-SIPEs (Fig. 5a), regardless of its compa - rable or reduced chain motion (Supplementary Fig. 19), confirming the essential role of sequence control on ion transport beyond Tg. Moreover, when PEO-1 was examined with lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulphonyl) imide (LiTFSI) as a dual-ion SPE, it crystallized at 30 °C and exhibited one-tenth of th",328

Based on Vogel–Tammann– Fulcher plots of conductivities measured at varying temperature (Fig. 5b and Supplementary Equation (9), P8 exhibited the lowest pseudo-activation energy (B parameter, 4.8 kJ mol−1) among the four SIPEs (Supplementary Table 10), showing an effectively reduced mass transport barrier assisted by sequence control. We evaluated σLi+ to partition effective Li+ transport from overall ionic conductivity. Alter-SIPE P8 yielded high tLi+ (0.84–0.93) between 30 and 70 °C based on the Bruce–Vincent method44, showing stable single-ion conduction characteristics (Fig. 5c and Supplementary Table 11). Of note is that P8 yielded σLi+ = 3.9 × 10−5 S cm−1 while the dual-ion SPE of PEO-1 provided only 1.8% Li+ conduction (σLi+ = 7.1 × 10−7 S cm−1) for P8 due to its low tLi+ (0.21). For random-, block- and homo-sequences (tLi+ = 0.90–0.95), the lower σLi+ values are mainly due to much weaker dissociation tendency, with no apparent correlation to crystallization (Supplementary Fig. 20). –80 –40 0 40 80 120 T (°C)Heat flow /uni2192P8 PEO-1 (20.0 kDa)Tg = –32 °CTc = 44 °C Tm = 65 °CP8Vinyl ether (n = 23)Intensity 0 4 8 12 16 q (nm–1)1 10 100 Angular frequency (rad s–1)G'' P12 (27.8 kDa)P",401

Hence, alter- SIPE P8 successfully delivered high Li+ conduc - tion in a dry polymer system that is on a par with the liquid-like dual-ion electrolyte PEO-2 (Supplementary Table 12) measured at 30 °C. As tracked by mean-squared displacement (MSD), the high Li+ conductivity of alter-SIPE P8 was supported by a steeper slope of Li+ diffusion coefficient (DLi+ = 4.0 × 10−9 cm2 s−1) at 30 °C, surpassing random-, block- and homo-sequences (Fig. 5d). Consistent with the simulated DLi+ of P8, experimental DLi+ as measured by pulsed-field gradient solid-state NMR was equivalent to that of liquid-like PEO-2 electrolyte (DLi+ = 3.2 × 10−9 versus 3.9 × 10−9 cm2 s−1). This diffusion coefficient is comparable to a highly conductive zwitterion electro - lyte32 and a liquid crystal–ionic liquid polymer composite system45, indicating accelerated ion transport kinetics in alter- SIPE compared with the other three sequences.

Initially Li+ is mainly coordinated with the anchoring anionic site with L–N distance 2.1 Å (state I). Subsequently Li+ undergoes an intermediate state II in which Li+ partially dissociates from the N centre of an anion and hops to the adjacent PEO pendant. In the third step, Li+ migrates along the alternating structure and forms Li–O coordination, resulting in a Li–O distance of 2.0 Å (state III). It is also possible for Li+ to hop back to another anionic centre and return to state I (Supplementary Fig. 5), revealing a contiguous avenue for ion migration46. Collectively, the proximity between alternately arranged polyanions and PEO anchoring groups could induce concerted PEO-Li+-anion migration and a unique sequence-assisted structural transport pathway. The competitive ligand coordination and coulombic interactions from the lithium salt and PEO pendant, rather than counteracting each other, work in synergy and induce ‘site-to-site’ continuous transport.

Blending random- and block-SIPEs with 20 wt% PEO-2 increased con - ductivity comparable to that of P8 at 30 °C (Supplementary Table 13), which facilitated Li plating-stripping cycling for 600 and 900 cycles with exacerbating polarization during cycling, indicating an unstable flux of Li+. When the liquid electrolyte of the PEO-2–LiTFSI composite was examined, dendritic lithium (Supplementary Fig. 24) formed and shorted the cell within 400 h.

When cycled at 70 °C, high specific capacities of 148 and 139 mAh g−1 were observed at 0.066 and 0.132 mA cm−2 geo (0.05 and 0.10 charge/ discharge (C) rates, respectively; Fig. 6b and Supplementary Fig. 26).

A high average CE of 99.3% was obtained with >40 cycles and 92% capacity retention at 30 °C. Comparatively, both random- SIPE–PEO-2 and block-SIPE– PEO-2 composites exhibited fluctuating CE and rapid capacity decay after 10–15 cycles, in accordance with accelerated dendrite formation during Li electrodeposition (Supplementary Fig. 28).

The alternating sequence of fluorinated Li-salt and PEO pendants enhances molecular-level homogeneity of ion distributions, modulated anion-Li+ complexation and hence improved Li+ dissociation and a unique sequence-assisted PEO-Li+-anion migration. In addition, alternating SIPE is able to dem- onstrate all-solid-state lithium metal battery operation at ambient temperature, addressing the long-standing problem with solid-state electrolytes. This work shows that polymer sequence can be more deli - cately programmed and various functionalities could be engineered, opening new avenues for highly efficient ion transport and versatile ion-conductive materials in energy devices beyond lithium batteries.

After sealing the vial with a rubber septum, the solution was deoxygenated with three freeze–pump–thaw cycles under N2. The mixture was then placed in front of a 13 W white light-emitting diode bulb for 24 h while cooling with compressed air to maintain 25 °C. After the reaction, an internal standard (ethyl benzoate, 1.0 mmol) was added to the mixture with stirring. A small aliquot was taken and analysed by 1H NMR to yield monomer conversion (conversion(%)). The sample was precipitated with toluene three times then dried under vacuum at 70 °C for 12 h before characterization. For details of materials used, see section 1 in Supplementary Information.

For solid-state NMR, a Bruker Advance III 400 MHz instrument was equipped with a static high-power probe to ensure a wide spectral excitation bandwidth by short, high-power excitation pulses7. Li NMR spectra were collected using an acquisition time of 0.0198 s, relaxation delay of 10 s, prescan delay of 10 μs and 128 scans. Pulsed-field gradient solid-state NMR measurements were carried out using an Advance III 600 MHz Bruker instrument and Diff50 probe at 30 °C. Solid polymer samples were packed into 5 mm Schott E NMR tubes and sealed with Teflon tape. Sixty-four scans at each gradient strength were used to ensure a good signal:noise ratio. Gradient pulse duration δ = 1 ms with a diffusion time Δ of 25 ms were used to obtain diffusion coefficients. Size exclusion chromatography. Size exclusion chromatography measurements were performed on a TOSOH instrument (0.1 M LiBr in N,N-dimethylformamide) equipped with a Bryce refractive index detector, and were conducted at 50 °C at an elution rate of 1 ml min−1.

However, it is known that, even at current den - sities below the diffusion limiting current, where most batteries are operated, poor chemical stability of liquid electrolytes in con - tact with the metal anode limits both the performance and safety of such cells 4–8. Premature battery failure may occur by a direct parasitic process, wherein the electrolyte continuously reacts with the electrode to deplete the electrolyte, thicken the electrode/ electrolyte interphases, and produce run-away cell resistances 9. Failure may also result from indirect processes produced by den - drite-induced internal short circuits10. Approaches including the design of sacrificial additives11, assembly of artificial solid electro - lyte interphase (SEI) layers12, and structured electrolytes (highly concentrated solvent-in-salt liquids13–15, nanoporous solids16 and solid-state electrolytes17) have been applied to address these chal - lenges with increasingly high levels of success. Solid-state electro - lytes (SSE) are considered particularly promising because of their in",330

Two principal types of SSEs have been studied to date: SSEs based on ion-conducting inorganic solids19,20 and SSEs based on organic polymers (so-called solid-state polymer electrolytes (SPEs))21–23. SPEs are considered attractive from a range of perspectives, includ - ing their superior mechanical toughness, lower cost, lightweight characteristics and compatibility with large-scale roll-to-roll manu - facturing processes. In general, a successful SPE is required to have at least two characteristics. First, it should enable high bulk ionic con - ductivity and fast interfacial transport of Li ions at both the anode and cathode of a battery. Second, it should remain mechanically stable and chemically inert during extended battery cycling. The most studied SPEs based on lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl) imide (LiTFSI) in poly(ethylene oxide) do not meet either of these requirements at room temperature.Various strategies have been reported in the literature to improve the electrochemical and mechanical properties of SPEs 24–27. The addition of inorganic fillers, either by physical mixing or by chemi - cally tethering polymer chains to inorganic nanostructures, has been used to create so-called hybrid SPEs with increased room tem - perature ionic conductivity28.

SPEs containing two or more salts and a plastic crystal plasitcizer have been reported to exhibit both high ionic conductivity and high voltage stability 32. Near-single Li-ion- conducting SPEs have been created by appending polyanions33,34 and ionic liquids35,36 to a polymer backbone. The hypothesis that motivates the present study is that form - ing SPEs in situ by polymerization of a liquid precursor would address the low ionic conductivity and high interface resistance of SPEs. Specifically, we take advantage of the beneficial properties of liquids, including low viscosity and easy handling, and the ability to wet and thereby create good interfacial contact with interfaces at essentially all length scales, to create electrochemical cells with well-connected pathways for ionic transport that enable full access to the active materials (Fig. 1a). Subsequent polymerization of the liquid electrolyte in the fully formed battery transforms the electro - lyte from a liquid-state material to a solid-state material. Beyond the obvious benefits already discussed, the approach also produces SPEs of high purity (that is, comparable to those achieved with cur - rent liquid electrolytes); provides a facile method for repairing bulk and interfacial defects in a SPE or ceramic SSE produced during electrolyte manufacture or battery assembly; and the same pro - cedures in current use for electrolyte handling and filling can be employed.

Here, we report that cationic aluminium species initiate ring-opening polymerization of molecular ethers inside an electrochemical cell to produce solid-state polymer electrolytes (SPEs), which retain conformal interfacial contact with all cell components. SPEs exhibit high ionic conductivity at room temperature (>1 mS cm−1), low inter - facial resistances, uniform lithium deposition and high Li plating/striping efficiencies (>98% after 300 charge–discharge cycles). Applications of SPEs in Li–S, Li–LiFePO4 and Li–LiNi0.6Mn0.2Co0.2O2 batteries further demonstrate that high Coulombic efficiency (>99%) and long life (>700 cycles) can be achieved with an in situ SPE design. Our study therefore provides a prom-ising direction for creating solid electrolytes that meet both the bulk and interfacial conductivity requirements for practical solid polymer batteries.

In 1964, Okada et al.38 reported that, in the presence of water, some organo-aluminium compounds, such as diethyl aluminium chloride and ethyl aluminium dichloride, initiate polymerization of DOL. Here, we are interested in electro - lyte salts that exhibit similar activity, but without adding water. The results reported here show that aluminium triflate (Al(CF3SO3)3 and Al(OTf)3) salts are efficient initiators for the polymerization of DOL and can be used to transform a DOL-based liquid electrolyte to a SPE at concentrations as low as 0.5 mM. We show that SPEs created in this manner overcome the most serious limitations of conven - tional SPEs. Structure, composition and kinetics of prepared SPes Figure 1 summarizes the essential chemical process whereby Al(OTf)3 initiates polymerization of DOL and transforms a liq - uid DOL-based electrolyte to an SPE. As illustrated in Fig. 1b , the reaction is initiated by a cationic aluminium species i",238

The inset digital picture in Fig. 1b shows that, on addition of as little as 0.5 mM Al(OTf) 3, the originally liquid LiTFSI-DOL electrolyte is transformed to a transparent, solid product. NMR analysis (Fig. 1c,d) confirms that the material is poly-DOL. Specifically, after the polymerization reaction, new hydrogen and carbon peaks are observed, which are in accordance with the structure of poly-DOL. In addition, the ratio of unpolymerized DOL and poly-DOL can be estimated by integrating the peak area of the 1H NMR spectra. The results sum - marized in Supplementary Table 1 show that the unpolymerized DOL fraction accounts, respectively, for 86, 19, 14 and 10% in the electrolytes formed at 0.2, 0.5, 1.0 and 5.0 mM Al(OTf) 3 initiator. These changes in composition occur in tandem with structural evolution, as reported by Fourier-transform infrared spectros - copy (FTIR) (Supplementary ",258
test_pdfs/008.pdf,2,3,"Fig. 1) and Raman spectroscopy analysis (Supplementary Fig. 2). While electrolyte with 0.2 mM Al(OTf) 3 manifests characteristic vibrations of the liquid DOL precursor, increasing the Al(OTf)3 content to 0.5 mM produces a virtual disappearance of the ring vibration, large shifts in the C–O–C vibration and emergence of vibration modes associated with long-chain species. The weight-averaged molecular weights (M w) of the poly-DOL were analysed by gel permeation chromatography.

Specifically, the higher concentration of Al(OTF)3 increases the initiation rate, causing more polymer chain formation, which would lower the overall polymer molecular weight—precisely what is observed. Additionally, because the DOL functions as both reactant and sol - vent, the polymer chain would become smaller—for reactant trans - port reasons, with increasing Al(OTf)3 content. Comparison of the poly-DOL molecular weights formed in our synthesis with the entanglement molecular weight (Me) of ~1,200 Da estimated from the packing model39 implies that at the lower Al(OTf)3 concentra - tions, the polymer exists minimally as a physical network of inter - connected/entangled chains. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was applied to study thermal transitions in the poly-DOL from heat flow measurements. The results reported in Fig. 2a and Supplementary Fig. 3 show that, whereas the salt-free poly-DOL is crystalline, the electrolyte (poly-DOL + 2 m LiTFSI, where 1 m stands for 1 M salt dissolved in 1 l solvent) is essentially amorphous.

We believe that the absence of crystallization in the in situ-formed poly-DOL electrolytes is a key determinant of their high bulk and interfacial ionic conduc - tivities. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) demonstrates that the thermal stability is largely improved after transferring liquid DOL electrolyte to poly-SPE (Supplementary Fig. 4).The kinetics of the polymerization process were studied next by means of time-dependent changes in the elastic and ion transport properties of the electrolyte. The results reported in Fig. 2b show that both the elastic/storage modulus (G′) and viscous/loss modulus (G′′) deduced from dynamic shear rheology measurements of the reaction mixture increase over time, reflecting the rising contribu - tion of growing polymer chains to the rheological characteristics of the electrolytes. For electrolytes containing 0.5 mM Al(OTf)3 cata - lyst, at early times (t < 600 s), the loss modulus is dominant (that is, G′′ > G′), indicating that the electrolytes are liquid-like. As the reac - tion proceeds, G′ is observed to become more dominant, indicative of a transition to solid-like, elastic behaviour as the growing polymer chains begin to form physical entanglemen",296

At long times, both moduli approach a constant, limiting value, and their ratio ( /uni03B4= /uni2032/uni2032/uni2215/uni2032 tan GG ), termed the loss tangent, approaches a constant value below unity. This behaviour is consistent with the onset of solid-like behaviour of elastic materials in which each material element is localized in a cage with ‘localization length’ 40: /uni03BE= /uni2215kT G ()B01 3 (/uni03BE/uni2245 .127nm). At double (1 mM) the Al(OTf)3 con - centration, both moduli are obviously higher and the rate at which they approach steady state increases noticeably. The tanδ plot shows that, at the higher Al(OTf) 3 concentration, the electrolytes are more solid-like, and the calculated localization length, ξ ~ 8.7 nm, bears this out. In contrast, an elastic contribution cannot be observed at an Al(OTf)3 concentration of 0.2 mM due to the low polymer frac - tion, despite the higher Mw of ~49 K revealed by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) analysis.

This mobile fluid fraction would be expected to facilitate both bulk and interfacial ion transport. NMR analysis of SPEs confirms this view and, in fact, shows that depending on the concentration of Al(OTf) 3 in the precursor liquid electrolyte, the extent of the polymerization reaction can be manipulated to produce varying amounts of resid - ual unpolymerized DOL in the poly-DOL host material. Increasing the concentration of Al(OTf) 3 above approximately 1 mM produces a sharply lower ionic conductivity (below 0.1 mS at steady state, which is thought to arise from the greater solidification and smaller localization length of poly-DOL SPEs.

At higher Al(OTf)3 concentrations, the measured conductivity is seen to be well described by either model, which is expected because the ionic conductivity is measured at temperatures far beyond the glass transition temperature. Closer inspection of the results nonetheless reveals that the Arrhenius expression provides a slightly better account of the low temperature conductivity, particu - larly at high Al(OTf)3 concentrations (1 and 5 mM). Our observa - tions suggest that the ion motions are decoupled from long-range motions of the polymer chains and may progress by an ion rafting process, wherein the unpolymerized component in the materials is the ion carrier at all Al(OTf) 3 concentrations. More detailed studies of ion transport over a wider range of temperatures are underway to evaluate this hypothesis. electrochemical properties of in situ-formed SPes The DOL-LiTFSI electrolyte precursor used to create our SPEs is not commonly used in Li batteries that employ interc",224

Linear sweep voltammetry measurements were used to determine the effect of polymerizing a liquid DOL electrolyte on the electrochemical stability window of the material. The results reported in Fig. 3a clearly show that polymerization dra - matically increases the oxidative stability to over 5 V . These same measurements show that for the liquid DOL-LiTFSI electrolyte, oxi - dation already occurs at around 4.2 V (Fig. 3a and Supplementary Fig. 7). In a wider-range scan from −0.2 to 6 V , the results show that polymerization does not compromise the excellent Li stripping/ plating profiles (inset in Fig. 3a). The electrochemical floating experiment provides a more strin - gent test of the oxidative stability of in situ-formed poly-DOL SPEs41.

In contrast, similar experiments using the liquid LiTFSI/ DOL electrolyte reveal leakage currents exceeding 1 mA at voltages as low as 4.3 V . A key hypothesis of our work is that in situ formation of SPEs provides an opportunity to overcome the traditionally high interfacial resistances characteristic of SSEs (Supplementary Fig. 8). A second hypothesis is that polymerization of a liquid electrolyte will reduce its reactivity towards a metallic Li anode, resulting in higher Coulombic efficiency and lithium metal batteries with lon - ger-term stability.

test_pdfs/008.pdf,6,1,"Articles Nature eNergyFigure 3c and Supplementary Fig. 9 compare the results from galvanostatic polarization experiments for the liquid DOL elec - trolyte and in situ SPEs. SPEs with 0.5 mM Al3+ were selected for in-depth study for two principal reasons. First, they show typical characteristics of SPEs, including existence as a free-standing film and manifesting viscoelastic solid-like properties in shear and ten - sile testing experiments. Second, in comparison with SPEs formed at higher Al3+ contents, SPEs with 0.5 mM Al3+ exhibit the highest combination of mechanical modulus and room temperature ionic conductivity. Both measurements were performed in asymmetric Li||Cu cells at a current density of 1 mA cm −2. Although the liq - uid electrolyte shows small polarization between Li stripping and plating, the Coulombic efficiency fades quite quickly (Fig. 3d and Supplementary Fig. 10). We attribute this behaviour to the contin - uous reduction of DOL by the freshly deposited Li metal in each cycle, which continuously consumes the electrolyte, thickens the SEI on Li, and limits access to the electrodeposited Li metal. In comparison, Li–Cu batteries with SPEs show consistent and high Coulom",267
test_pdfs/008.pdf,6,2,"bic efficiency (>98%), even after 300 Li strip–plate cycles. The reversibility of Li plating and stripping processes in in situ- formed poly-DOL SPEs and their unpolymerized liquid analogues was investigated in symmetric Li cells. As shown in Fig. 3e , for the initial tens of cycles, lower polarization is observed in the liquid electrolytes, presumably because of their higher ionic conductivity. However, after 100 cycles, an obvious but gradual increase in the peak-to-peak voltage is evident for measurements performed in liq - uid electrolytes. This increase is indicative of the greater difficulty of nucleating Li during the plating segment of the cycle and strip - ping Li during the reversing segment of the cycle, and the overall deposition of Li. It is normally associated with the formation of a thick SEI at the electrode and the accumulation of electronically disconnected/dead Li fibrils at the interface 42. The process typically ends with a sudden, permanent drop in peak-to-peak voltage and a noticeable squaring of the edges of the voltage profile (see inset in Fig. 3e for the 201st and 202nd cycle), which is thought to arise from the formation of one or more internal short circuits ",254

In comparison, SPE cells continue to oper - ate stably beyond 200 cycles. In addition, the structure of poly-DOL SPEs is unchanged from the beginning to the end of the cycling (see FTIR (Supplementary Fig. 11) and NMR spectra (Supplementary Fig. 12)). SeI and Li electrodeposition The components and chemical states of SEI formed on an Li metal anode using poly-DOL electrolytes were also studied. The Li har - vested from cells in which liquid DOL was the electrolyte mani - fested a distinctive black colouration after cycling, and obvious cracks are shown in Fig. 4a. In contrast, the surfaces of Li harvested from cells based on the poly-DOL electrolyte exhibited almost no change in colour, and compact, flat topography after 50 cycles (Fig. 4c). According to energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) analysis, the major elements on the cycled Li anode in the liquid DOL electrolyte are carbon, oxygen, fluorine and sulfur (Fig. 4b). In the case of poly-DOL SPEs, we not only found these four ele - ments, but also discovered a small amount of aluminium (Fig. 4d). In general, the count",292

The C1 s spectra show considerably higher binding energy peaks for the liq - uid DOL electrolyte, which should belong to the decomposition of DOL and formation of CO 32− and COOR components ( Fig. 4e)43,44.

In comparison, the major peaks of poly-DOL belong to the segment of polymer chain (Fig. 4l)45. Meanwhile, the liquid DOL electrolyte also undergoes more serious reduction of salts, and typical LiF peaks (Fig. 4f ) and Li2S (Fig. 4g) peaks are detected29,45. Poly-DOL SPEs can also gen - erate a considerable amount of LiF on their surfaces (Fig. 4j), which has now been well acknowledged in the literature as beneficial for stable Li deposition 46. However, the less conductive Li2S is very small on the Li surface (Fig. 4k). Furthermore, we found that the aluminium species tends to slowly move to the interfaces between the Li anode and SPE. As shown for a cycled Li anode with poly- DOL SPE (Fig. 4l), a broad peak belong to the aluminium element is found on the surface of the Li anode. The aluminium complex (AlF 3 and Al2O3) is also crucial in stabilizing the Li electrode47,48. We conclude that during battery operation, polymerization of DOL also occurs by reduction of DOL at the surface of the Li anode. An advantage of the in situ-formed SPE is that the majority of the electrolyte solvent is polymerized, rather than just a relativ",311

The morphology of Li electrodeposits in liquid DOL electrolytes and in situ-formed poly-DOL SPEs can be probed directly using optical visualization studies. Because the measurements are per - formed without a separator, they allow us to eliminate any effects of separator pressure on the observations. For the symmetrical cells using liquid electrolyte, mossy Li electrodeposits are apparent as early as ten minutes after inception of the deposition (Fig. 5a). The uneven loose Li deposits are large enough to be seen clearly by the unaided eye (Fig. 5b). These observations are consistent with failure mechanisms already inferred from the analysis in Fig. 3 , but they clearly provide a more critical/accelerated assessment of the short - comings of the liquid DOL electrolyte. In comparison, Li plating observed using poly-DOL SPEs is more compact. Indeed, when viewed either by optical (Fig. 5c) or scanning electron microscopy (SEM; Fig. 5d) methodologies even after 2 mAh cm −2, the surface of the electrodeposited Li remains visibly flat. We therefore pro - pose that both the mechanical and chemical stability imparted by polymerizing the liquid DOL electrolytes lead to obvious improve - ments in the uniformity of Li p",273

The elasticity of poly-DOL SPEs provides a mechanism for the interphase to flex and stretch, without cracking, to accommodate volume change during electro - deposition, which we believe facilitates uniform electrodeposition of Li. The polymerization of DOL to form SPEs is also thought to enhance the already good chemical stability of DOL in contact with metallic Li. In that case, the side reactions towards the metal surface are suppressed. This combination of features, including the organic elastic polymer, aluminium complex and LiF-rich inorganic com - pounds, is considered responsible for the impressive interfacial properties of SPEs. Full cell demonstration of in situ-formed SPes The advantages of in situ-formed SPEs make them suitable for rechargeable Li metal batteries using various cathode materials, such as sulfur, Li–LiNi 0.6Mn0.2Co0.2O2(NMC) and LiFePO4 (LFP). Li–S batteries have been widely studied for their high theoretical gravimetric energy density.

As demonstrated in Fig. 6a, Li–S cells using the poly- DOL SPE electrolyte and a CMK-3 (an ordered mesoporous car - bon material)/sulfur composite cathode can be operated under a wider voltage range and display high Coulombic efficiencies close to 100%, in comparison with the DOL electrolyte (Supplementary Figs. 13 and 14). Capacity–voltage curves for Li–S cells using the poly-DOL SPE also display two typical discharge peaks and one charging peak (Supplementary Fig. 15). The cycling performance is also noticeably improved relative to the liquid DOL electrolyte. The Coulombic efficiency remains over 98% after 100 cycles, even at a relatively small discharge/charge rate of 0.1 C (about 0.3 mA cm −2) (Supplementary Fig. 16). Notably, these benefits of the poly-DOL SPEs are also apparent at current densities as high as 0.5 C. The success of the poly-SPE as an electrolyte for a conversion cathode is just one test of our hypothesis that underpins its impact. Additional tests include whether such electrolytes can function with intercalating cathodes, where, conventionally, electrolyte perme - ation into the porous cathode architecture is a requirement for good ion transport in the electrode. Here, we evaluate this possibility using cycling studies of Li/poly-DOL SPE/NMC (622) and Li/poly-DOL SPE/LFP cells. Fig. 6b shows the discharge/charge curves for solid- state Li/poly-DOL SPE/NMC (622) cells. Compared with the cor - responding Li/DOL/NMC (622) cells, which exhibit low Coulombic efficiencies and fast capacity fading (Supplementary Fig. 17), the solid-state batteries display both high Coulombic efficiencies and excellent reversibility. The corresponding results for the solid-state Li/poly-DOL SPE/LFP batteries are reported in Fig. 6c. These cells are likewise observed to display high levels of reversibility and nearly flat discharge plateaus for over 100 charge–discharge cycles at room temperature (Fig. 6c and Supplementary Figs. 18 and 19). The results from higher-rate (1 C) and longer-term cycling studies reported in Fig. 6d show that Coulombic efficiencies close to 100%, and relatively stable cycling, are achieved even after 700 cycles. When an ex situ-formed SPE is used for Li-LFP cells, very large polarization is observed, even at low rates (Supplementary Fig. 20). Conclusions We report that initiating polymerization of liquid electrolytes inside an electrochemical",571
test_pdfs/008.pdf,8,2," cell using low concentrations of soluble Al(OTf) 3 salt provides a powerful approach for creating SPEs with mS cm−1 levels of room temperature ionic conductivity and low interfacial impedances. As a result, the SPEs developed in this study do not suffer from limitations associated with poor bulk and inter - facial ion transport common to all SSEs. Deployment of SPEs as electrolytes in symmetric Li/Li and asymmetric Li/Cu cells shows that they enable high cell-level Coulombic efficiency and excellent reversibility in Li stripping/plating processes. As a final demonstra - tion, we use the electrolytes to create solid-state batteries utilizing conversion (for example, sulfur) and intercalating (for example, LFP and NMC) cathode chemistries. In so doing, we show that in situ polymer generation in an electrochemical cell provides a promising path to solid-state batteries in a range of chemistries. Methods Electrolyte preparation. Electrolyte preparation and cell assembly were conducted in an argon gas-filled glove box (Inert), in which both the O2 and H2O content were maintained below 0.5 ppm. The raw materials, including LiTFSI (TCI America; ≥98.0%) and Al(OTf)3 (Alfa Aesar; 99%), were stored in the glove box and used without further purification. Before all experiments, DOL (anhydrous; contains ~75 ppm butylated hydroxytoluene as an inhibitor; 99.8%; Sigma–Aldrich) was treated overnight with coarse pieces of sacrificial metallic Li foil to chemically ‘dry’ the materials through reaction of the sacrificial Li with any traces of water remaining in the electrolytes. Liquid DOL-LITFSI and DOL-Al(OTf) 3 electrolytes containing different contents of the respective salts were prepared by adding the desired stoichiometric amounts of salt into DOL with vigorous stirring. Electrolyte compositions used in the study were created by diluting the homogeneous solutions of DOL-Al(OTf) 3 with appropriate amounts of DOL-LITFSI to create initially liquid DOL electrolytes containing variable fractions of Al(OTf)3.Cathode and battery preparation. Sulfur cathodes were prepared by mixing sulfur/CMK-3 composites, Super P carbon as a conductivity aid, and polyvinylidene fluoride at a weight ratio of 84:8:8 in NMP solvent to form a smooth slurry. The slurry was ball milled for half an hour and painted on a carbon- coated aluminium foil. The cathodes were dried in a vacuum oven to remove the NMP solvent. The sulfur loading of e",567
test_pdfs/008.pdf,8,3,"ach cathode was about 2.0 mg cm −2. LFP cathodes were prepared by a similar procedure, and the LFP loading was about 5 mg cm −2. CMK-3/sulfur composites were prepared using a typical melting– diffusion method50. The sulfur content was about 60 wt% in the CMK-3/sulfur composites. Nickel cobalt manganese oxide (NCM (622)) cathodes were obtained from Electrodes and More. Coin 2032-type cells were assembled using Li foil as the anode and glass fibre or Celgard 3501 as the separator. The separator was used in the assembly of cells to provide separation and control the thickness of the SPE, which can avoid short circuit in the liquid state. For prepared free-standing SPEs, no separator was used. All electrochemical cell performances were tested under room temperature. Material characterizations. Liquid LiTFSI-DOL electrolytes and poly-DOL electrolytes were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide-d 6 for 1H NMR and 13C NMR analysis. GPC measurements were performed by first dissolving the synthesized poly-DOL electrolytes in THF and eluting the solutions in a Waters ambient temperature GPC equipped with triple detection capability for absolute polymer molecular weight determination. FTIR spectra of the materials were characterized using a Thermo Scientific spectrometer in the attenuated total reflection mode. d.c conductivity and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy were performed using a Novocontrol broadband dielectric/impedance spectrometer. The morphologies of Li after plating were imaged by field emission SEM. DSC was tested using a Q1000 Modulated Differential Scanning Calorimeter (TA Instruments). Oscillatory shear rheology was conducted using a strain-controlled ARES-LS (Rheometric Scientific) rheometer outfitted with cone and plate geometry (10 mm diameter; 4° cone angle) to monitor the polymerization reaction in real time. The oscillatory shear experiments were carried out with strain γ = 1% and angular frequency ω = 1 rad s −1 at ambient temperature (24 °C) for 2 h. Reaction components were taken out of the glove box and mixed before they were loaded in the instrument. For small-amplitude oscillatory shear measurements, frequency sweeps from 0.1 to 100 rad s −1 were performed at a shear strain γ = 0.1% to study the response of materials in the linear viscoelastic regime. Tensile measurements were performed at ambient temperature using a stress-controlled DMA Q800 (TA Instruments). Materials were taken ",540
test_pdfs/008.pdf,8,4,"directly from the glove box before they were loaded. TGA tests were performed at room temperature to 500 °C under an N 2 atmosphere at a temperature increase of 5 °C min−1. The instrument used for TGA testing was a TG/DTA 6200. Raman tests were conducted using a Renishaw inVia confocal Raman microscope at an excitation wavelength of 785 nm. AnSSX-100 XPS spectrometer was used to study SEI layers on the Li surface. The cycled Li was washed sufficiently with DOL and dimethoxyethane and dried in the glove box. Electrochemical cells test. The in situ Li plating images were recorded using a Dino-Lite digital microscope. A homemade cuvette cell with two parallel Li electrodes inside was used to observe morphological changes of Li surfaces in real time. Galvanostatic discharge/charge tests were performed using a Neware battery tester at room temperature. A CH 600E electrochemical workstation was used for the cyclic voltammetry measurements. The electrochemical floating experiments were conducted in Li||NMC cells, which were charged to 4.2 V first, then held at progressively higher voltages, each for a period of 10 h.
