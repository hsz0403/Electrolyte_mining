"Note: ""N/A"" is used for properties that were not explicitly mentioned in the provided text. Different sections report on temperatures and methods applicable for the synthesis and examination of polymer electrolytes with altered sequences, leading to significant improvements in lithium-ion conductivity and transference numbers by structuring monomers and creating specific sequences. This approach enables high-performance all-solid-state lithium batteries at lower operational temperatures by optimizing ion dissociation and mobility."
